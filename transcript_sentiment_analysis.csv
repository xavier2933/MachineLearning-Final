So  how you doing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Great  how about you?,0.6249,0.577,0.423,0.0,p10
I'm okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p10
I'm a little [???],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
by the resurgence of the hurricane  but.. [laughter] I understand  I got to get home later too and I'm worried.,0.3612,0.171,0.717,0.112,p10
Yeah  we were half way here and it just turned on a switch  lightening  winds and everything.,0.296,0.121,0.879,0.0,p10
Oh wow.,0.5859,0.792,0.208,0.0,p10
So yeah.,0.3597,0.714,0.286,0.0,p10
So  uh  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Okay  um  I'm a Junior here at MIT  um  I'm studying aerospace engineering  um  my  my interests are generally in food mechanics  control  um  design  um  mostly aircraft  but protozoan [???],0.3591,0.107,0.893,0.0,p10
problems in general.,-0.4019,0.0,0.426,0.574,p10
Um  I like to  um  I like to play music  listen to music  um  I run  do some other team sports  I like to play hockey.,0.8834,0.369,0.631,0.0,p10
Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Um  okay  so  uh  one of the projects that I've worked on since coming to MIT  um  was during my Freshman year  I worked in the  in the uh  Artificial Intelligence group in  uh  Cesil [sp]  which is a lab  a computer science lab here at MIT.,0.6124,0.1,0.9,0.0,p10
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p10
And  um  I was working on a project with another student  actually another Freshman  uh  basically we were tasked with the  sort of  bringing this project  starting this project  bring it up to the level where it could be presented at conference.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Um  together  and we were kind of left  to work out the cooperation on our own and um   there was  um  as the conference got closer  about halfway  um  about halfway through the year Freshman year  ah  there were a bunch of issues that we had with um  with um  basically meeting the expectations that had been set before us in terms of what we were going to present.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Um  and finishing in a timely basis.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
And it came down to whether we were really going to be able to  and there were other basically  parts  other people's work in the same group where work depended on us finishing in time  so it really  um  really  we had to make a decision weather we were just going to basically get done what we could  but to the quality standard that  the standard of quality that was expected of us  or to um  try to finish everything and to have other people's work potentially suffer because of our [??],-0.7278,0.0,0.947,0.053,p10
hadn't really been up to snuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
And  um  and so  we kind of had a little bit of a disagreement about this  but what ended up happening was  um  I went and talked to the professor and um  sort of decided to um  make them aware of what was happening  because they weren't really aware that we had fallen behind.,-0.6124,0.0,0.912,0.088,p10
And  um  sort of got the other student on board  who had disagreed with me  uh to do this  uh  and to let everyone else know what was going on  and uh  we ended up presenting a lot less than what was originally expected  but  um  I think it was very much for the better.,0.4939,0.066,0.906,0.028,p10
Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,p10
How did you solve the problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p10
Okay  um  so  another  another thing that I spend a lot of my time doing is called  is an organization called Design  Build  Fly here  um  it's  it's a design competition um  run by the IAA  which is an aerospace professional organization.,0.2263,0.044,0.956,0.0,p10
And um   and uh  you can enter a team from any university or group  basically anywhere in the world.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
It's mostly US university though.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
And  um  these university teams basically build a plane  um  design it  build it  fly it as the competition name suggests and you compete them all at the end of the year  compete against the other universities at the end of the year at one competition.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Basically  um  last year we had  uh  a design challenge  it was pretty unique  um  and um  so  I'll take that as our challenge  um  so we basically had a year to solve this  um  and I was head of one of the sub-groups last year  the actual design sub-group  and um  I mean  we approached in a methodical way  just like I think that's the best way to solve most problems.,0.8935,0.211,0.753,0.036,p10
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p10
Um  got input from every team member  um  and um  basically  um  looked at  looked at all our possibilities  um   and um we ran the numbers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Ultimately  like I think that's the best way to solve most problems.,0.6712,0.436,0.41,0.154,p10
We ended up with um  a design that got the best overall score... Mm-hmm.,0.6369,0.244,0.756,0.0,p10
...on the basis of just  basically incorporating  um  every team member's input.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,p10
Okay  um  so one of my  I think definitely since coming here  I've noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication.,0.2732,0.17,0.738,0.092,p10
Um  I really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school  but I um  definitely since coming here  I find that perhaps um at the expense of technical skills  my written communication skills have atrophied  maybe is the right word.,0.6581,0.116,0.884,0.0,p10
And  um  so I definitely  I think I'm um  pretty aware of this and um  and um.. I would definitely like to improve it and um... Mm-hmm.,0.9228,0.394,0.606,0.0,p10
...so what I'm going to do is try to force myself whenever I'm writing papers or taking reports for  whether it be for research or for classes  just to go through the proper revision cycle  force myself to make sure that I'm actually being  um  that I'm being succinct in what I'm saying  have other people reading give me feedback.,0.3182,0.038,0.962,0.0,p10
Now why do you think that we should hire you for this position?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Okay  um  I  um  I mean  I think  I don't know what this position that it is... Whatever position you want at a company that you're looking for.,0.296,0.11,0.89,0.0,p10
Yeah  sure  but if I knew that this position was  I think that I would want it because um  this is really what I thrive off of.,0.4019,0.164,0.836,0.0,p10
I  um  enjoy doing it  um  and I would be excited to come to work every day to do it.,0.6808,0.237,0.763,0.0,p10
Um  which  um  that's like the biggest thing for me.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p10
I um  I would be excited to come do it and I know I would put my  you know  put my all into doing a good job at it  because I would be excited to come do it.,0.7717,0.18,0.82,0.0,p10
And  um  I think that um  I have a decent skill set to do this and I think that I'm qualified to contribute in this area.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p10
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,p10
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Uhh  I’m a junior at MIT  uhh I’m double majoring in Management and Biology  er  I’m very interested in the world of finance  uh  business  consulting all of those sorts of things.,0.4576,0.088,0.912,0.0,p11
Um  so I’ve tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh  those sort of roles in the business world.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Outside of school  I enjoy running  cross-country and track  I’m on the varsity team at MIT.,0.4939,0.176,0.824,0.0,p11
And umm  I’m also very involved in Greek Life at MIT  so I’m on the Panhellenic Executive Board as Vice President of Programming  and also hold a leadership position in my sorority.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p11
Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Umm  so I think this past year  my biggest priority has been my position as Vice President of Programming for Panhellenic and umm  just in that position  uhh  I hold a leadership role on the exec board.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
We have weekly meetings  I’m charge of putting together our programming calendar for our entire year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
So I have interface with a lot of MIT faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities uhh  to meet and attend different events.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
And I think to put together all these events I’m working together with different people on campus I have to show leadership and show strong communication skills.,0.5106,0.113,0.887,0.0,p11
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p11
So  tell me about a time you were working on a team  and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p11
How did you guys overcome that?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Umm  so I guess this past semester actually  I’m associate advisor for umm  freshmen and I work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor  and er   the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and I think we all  er  were very uhh  set on our ideas.,0.2732,0.035,0.965,0.0,p11
So having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Um  so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first  ‘cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from.,-0.25,0.058,0.846,0.096,p11
But after that  and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be  we eventually figured out what we wanted to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Can you be more specific about that  what you eventually figured out?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Uhh  yeah so  we had — we were trying to communicate via email at first  so I think that was  uhh inefficient  especially since we had only met in a group once before  umm so meeting in person and really  trying to outline not just like   what the event was going to be  what our purpose of the event was going to be  and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen.,0.0232,0.03,0.942,0.028,p11
I think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event  we were able to build it up from there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Okay  so can tell me about some of your weakness?,-0.2263,0.15,0.63,0.22,p11
Do you have any idea?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Umm  so I think one of my weaknesses is public speaking  actually  and uhh  I think by taking a variety of classes  especially this one class that I’m in  that focuses on management and communication .,-0.3612,0.0,0.933,0.067,p11
I’ve been kind of thrown into positions where I have to give impromptu speeches  uhh  and debate my point in different arguments and I think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what I’m saying  which I think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general.,0.893,0.197,0.766,0.037,p11
I think I’ve been able to build up my confidence and know like  how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better.,0.8271,0.303,0.697,0.0,p11
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p11
So why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p11
Uhh  I think my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience  umm would allow me to perform well on the job.,0.6249,0.234,0.766,0.0,p11
I think  I’ve worked umm  both individually in a project as well as in a team-focused environment  which umm  I think is key for consulting and investment banking positions.,0.2732,0.07,0.93,0.0,p11
I also feel that my MIT background  uh  the quantitative analysis that I’ve done in classes  as well as my internship experiences would help perform well on the job as well  so… Great.,0.9022,0.319,0.681,0.0,p11
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p12
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p12
So  why don't you tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Ok  so  I'm a Junior at MIT majoring in Mechanical Engineering.,0.296,0.18,0.82,0.0,p12
Uh my focus is in uh Robotics and Product Design.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Uh I'm originally from Seattle  Washington.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Any extracurriculars  any interests?,0.25,0.4,0.6,0.0,p12
Ummm I'm really interested in a combination of robotics and like psychology  phased in.,0.6697,0.314,0.686,0.0,p12
So artificial intelligence  or that vein of thinking.,0.5233,0.326,0.674,0.0,p12
Um I'm also  I do a little bit of theater on the side.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
So  considering doing some sort of combination.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
It's a wide range of interests so I'm trying to figure out a way to uh put in a lot of it into one thing but  yeah.,0.5106,0.147,0.853,0.0,p12
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p12
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Yeah  ok.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p12
So  um  in high school I was a life guard.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
And that's  it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a  a team situation.,0.3716,0.096,0.904,0.0,p12
Um  and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi-  like we taught swim lessons.,0.6124,0.147,0.853,0.0,p12
And I would have a partner with me and we'd both be teaching the same kids.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
And  I'd have to  you know  tell them what to do  or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
That sort of stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Ok great.,0.743,1.0,0.0,0.0,p12
What about  can you tell me about a time you worked on a team  and you had a conflict or challenge  and how you went about solving that.,0.1027,0.119,0.806,0.074,p12
Ok ummm  not going to use the lifeguard example again.,0.296,0.196,0.804,0.0,p12
(both laugh) Uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot  ummm I don't know in history class or that kind of a thing  work  working with projects.,0.5574,0.101,0.899,0.0,p12
And sometimes we'd have kids who wouldn't do their home- do  you know their part on time  or people who didn't like they  what they were doing.,-0.2755,0.0,0.925,0.075,p12
There was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didn't really want to do you know any of the  any of the project  she wasn't really showing up to class  wasn't doing any of the  any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her  and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way.,-0.4082,0.03,0.891,0.079,p12
Can you be more specific?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
In what way?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Like - Like  you  you just spoke with her?,0.6124,0.417,0.583,0.0,p12
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p12
So I mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
And then  Oh ok  ok.,0.296,0.355,0.645,0.0,p12
Ok  ok.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p12
The next  the next day when the girl came to class we  you know sat her down  asked her why she wasn't doing the homework.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Whatever  that kind of stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
But it was  it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
So (laughs).,0.5413,0.777,0.223,0.0,p12
Right  ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p12
Ok ummm  I have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once  and I sometimes put too much on my plate.,-0.3804,0.076,0.793,0.131,p12
And I recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when they've given you too much to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
So I think it's kind of  in terms of how I'm trying to improve that  is be realistic with myself on the amount of time I have or what my skills are.,0.4404,0.086,0.914,0.0,p12
And if I need help ask for it or if I need someone to do part of it  ask for it.,0.4019,0.119,0.881,0.0,p12
And early on  not the day before something has to be done  tell them that it's not going to happen.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
And last question - why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p12
Ummmm I think you should hire me because your company  ummm is a great  would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an Engineer umm and I think I could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like  like my wide interests  and  and education background.,0.9633,0.303,0.697,0.0,p12
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p13
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p13
So  why don't you tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Ok  umm  I'm currently a junior at M.I.T.,0.296,0.239,0.761,0.0,p13
studying electrical engineering and computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Umm  I first became interested in engineering in high school  I guess  when I worked in a lab at  a material science lab  at U.C.,0.4019,0.101,0.899,0.0,p13
Berkley.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Umm  and since then I've worked at a variety of different places including labs and at  uh  and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here  and at Standford  and umm Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Umm  in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon.,0.34,0.146,0.854,0.0,p13
I was the principle bassoon there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
So  that means I was in charge of the bassoon section.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
So basically  umm  I ran extra  I ran practices for  within our section outside of  uh   when the orchestra would get together and practice.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Mm Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
I coordinated that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
I also  uh  set up events between the woodwind sections to  uh you know  so people would get to know each other and  you know  we could practice together and things like that.,0.3612,0.072,0.928,0.0,p13
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p13
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Tell me about time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.091,0.909,0.0,p13
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p13
Umm  this past summer I worked in Spain.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Umm  in operations research and I was part of a research group there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Umm  it was  so  we had  uh  within our team  it was  communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isn't so great and their English wasn't so great.,-0.8392,0.034,0.752,0.215,p13
Mm hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
So  umm  what we ended  we basically communicated through like  the papers  through the papers we read  umm  we  well  one thing that helped was  we both got  like everyone  they got better at speaking English  I got better at understanding them.,0.8979,0.259,0.741,0.0,p13
I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also.,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,p13
So  we were able to communicate by just  you know  talking really slowly  repeating everything a couple times.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Umm  we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that.,0.3612,0.106,0.894,0.0,p13
Those were written mostly in English  so that was  that wasn't so much of a problem for me...but...it made it  because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area  looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was  what I was supposed to do.,0.0258,0.048,0.906,0.046,p13
Umm  things like that.,0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0,p13
Ok  great.,0.743,1.0,0.0,0.0,p13
Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you were doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.865,0.135,p13
umm  well  one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and  uh  it becomes a problem because its  it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of  like  the big picture.,-0.4588,0.097,0.742,0.161,p13
But since coming to M.I.T.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
I've been  I've been involved in a lot of classes  a lot of activites and things and that's forced me to manage my time better.,-0.0258,0.1,0.796,0.104,p13
So  now that  uh  like  I have  because I have a lot of time constraints  I'm forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever  and I can't  I can't get caught up in  like  little things that don't ultimately make a big a difference.,0.25,0.1,0.84,0.06,p13
So  um  by being forced to manage my time more  I'm  uh  overcoming this problem.,-0.729,0.0,0.68,0.32,p13
Great  ok.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,p13
So  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p13
Well  I have the  I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish  uh  accomplish project goals and get things done.,0.7717,0.288,0.712,0.0,p13
Uh  I can solve problems and  and can work pretty well in a team.,0.5267,0.359,0.505,0.136,p13
Ok I'm also very interested in what this company does  and  um  I'd really like to work there.,0.7897,0.347,0.653,0.0,p13
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p13
So  how are you doing today Good  how are you?,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,p14
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p14
I'm a student at MIT and Im a junior right now but I'm probably gonna graduate this year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p14
So  uh  that's kind of exciting at scary at the same time.,-0.0754,0.18,0.621,0.199,p14
Uh  like I said I'm a computer science major so some of the stuff that I'm interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff.,0.6369,0.172,0.828,0.0,p14
I've got a bunch of experience with web development mainly  uh front end development so that's uh  I guess where a lot of my experience lies.,-0.4215,0.0,0.899,0.101,p14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p14
Um  so I was  a member of the Society of Women Engineers and with the Graduate Students Association of MIT and the senior class  they run the fall career fair which is the only career fair in the fall and it's the biggest at MIT.,0.5574,0.097,0.903,0.0,p14
I was actually the publicity chair for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p14
So  it involves you know  interfacing  you know  with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guide book and making sure all of the information is readily available to students but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself.,0.5574,0.097,0.903,0.0,p14
SO  um  it definitely was a lot of responsibility and not only did I have to become a leader for the Society of Women Engineers but also fora leader for this smaller team of seven people that ran the career fair itself.,0.6442,0.116,0.884,0.0,p14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p14
How did you overcome that problem.,-0.4019,0.0,0.649,0.351,p14
Well  I...so  for one of my classes  we have to  it's a software design class where you have to work with other students.,0.2732,0.087,0.913,0.0,p14
So  I was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasn't pulling their weight and wasn't contributing in a way that was you know  fair and even  and so what we ended up doing is  we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk.,0.6249,0.098,0.902,0.0,p14
We were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her  it was not playing off her strengths.,-0.1742,0.066,0.828,0.107,p14
So  we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths.,0.8379,0.32,0.68,0.0,p14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,p14
Um  I think one of my weaknesses is I'm a perfectionist so when I do work on teams I have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because I want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is.,-0.0258,0.135,0.751,0.115,p14
But what I've done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um  like  say no to a task and just kind of  I guess  modualize [sic] projects more.,0.1154,0.085,0.841,0.074,p14
So  I think I had trouble when I was always thinking big picture and then I would want to look at every single detail i that big picture.,-0.34,0.043,0.867,0.09,p14
But if I just give myself one part of the project and just  you know  divide it into different modules in my head then I'm able to just  you know  perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail.,0.7227,0.107,0.893,0.0,p14
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p14
Uh  I think that my skill set is pretty unique because I'm both technical and also well-spoken and I'd be able to communicate really well.,0.6801,0.196,0.804,0.0,p14
And I think it's a unique combination to have both of those skills.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p14
Okay so how are you doing today?,0.2263,0.241,0.759,0.0,p15
I'm doing fine uh  thank you how about you?,0.5106,0.381,0.619,0.0,p15
Um  have you like you know um  the storm  I hope that hasn't like disturbed any power too much.,0.6677,0.307,0.607,0.085,p15
No actually it was fine I was expecting it to be a lot worse.,-0.5423,0.099,0.608,0.293,p15
I think a lot of people were a lot worse off than I was.,-0.4767,0.0,0.807,0.193,p15
Oh yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p15
I mean Boston didn't get hit too bad so.,-0.5423,0.0,0.696,0.304,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
That's at least very fortunate.,0.4927,0.444,0.556,0.0,p15
Great so can you tell me about yourself?,0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0,p15
Um  okay so I'm a current junior at MIT.,0.2263,0.192,0.808,0.0,p15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p15
I'm studying biological engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  so it's some  some of the things I do on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  I'm really involved in um  MIT Met Life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
So I'm  I'm secretary of the club and I go to the meetings um  and um  part of my roles like help you know organize groups where um  poster sessions and information sessions.,0.6369,0.144,0.856,0.0,p15
Just like spread the word of Met Life on campus um  and that's um  sort of helps me like explore like it has really gotten me more interested in a field of like healthcare.,0.9231,0.353,0.647,0.0,p15
Um  that plus like my um  my studies.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  I'm also involved in Chinese student club escort culture.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
So I do a lot of you know pudding on campus for um  events like night market which I worked  I helped organize just last week.,0.3612,0.091,0.909,0.0,p15
Oh okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p15
So um  it that sort of helps me with communication  my communication skills.,0.3197,0.161,0.839,0.0,p15
You know talking to the officers of other student clubs.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p15
So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Okay so um  last um  uh  this past summer I worked in a research lab in Bangkok and it was the first time that I had ever been outside of you know the United States for an extended period of time.,0.5719,0.108,0.892,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
And one of my assignments was to you know sort of lead uh  sort of like drive the direction of like a research project that they were doing  which was to research um  a generic um  in hopes of releasing it to the market.,0.7584,0.155,0.845,0.0,p15
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p15
Um  sometime in the future.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Because I had  I was partnered up with some a lab partner that was less experienced than I was um  I found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments.,0.4019,0.052,0.948,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  it was  it was a little bit of a strange dynamic because she was older than me.,0.2023,0.127,0.784,0.088,p15
Because she was an incoming graduate student  but she did not have much research like lab experience.,0.5023,0.169,0.831,0.0,p15
So I had to balance like being informative without making it seem like this  like she was in some ways my superior.,0.8853,0.387,0.613,0.0,p15
So that was like an um  I had  I had to like teach her the techniques you know coming off as like oh I know more than you do.,0.7759,0.23,0.77,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  but what I found was what worked for both of us was that um I would like explain it to her before we were in the lab which helped cut down a lot of the frustration that came up if like she had to ask me questions like every  like between like every set.,0.8573,0.229,0.676,0.096,p15
So that's um  that's probably the one way I showed leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p15
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge and what you did to solve that problem.,-0.1531,0.116,0.784,0.101,p15
Okay so the  a couple um  IPs I worked for a start up um  they were a green billing research directory  Okay.,0.4215,0.16,0.84,0.0,p15
online.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
And I worked for my fellow exterior on helping to market this  the use of this directory to the clients.,0.296,0.104,0.896,0.0,p15
Um  so we had to  it was a little bit difficult because we had to like  we had to cold call like people and getting over the initial awkwardness of what it's like to talk to somebody you've never met or seen before and trying to like pitch an idea to them  and be like oh there's this really great resource and you've signed up for it.,0.9181,0.212,0.739,0.049,p15
But we've noticed that you like hadn't used it.,0.5023,0.289,0.711,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  are there things that like you feel would make it better.,0.6597,0.351,0.649,0.0,p15
Um  things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective.,0.7089,0.296,0.704,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
And um  we both had to sort of like teach ourselves how to talk to like the  the reps that we're calling and we would um  strategize what worked  what didn't  what had people respond and what didn't  and- Mm-hm.,0.5729,0.11,0.89,0.0,p15
And by like documenting it all down also.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p15
So that we could leave like a record of what worked for maybe someone else was to found.,0.3182,0.127,0.812,0.061,p15
So um  eventually we actually got like a system.,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,p15
Like a way we would structure the questions and ask them that word and like list like a couple response.,0.7579,0.306,0.694,0.0,p15
Great all right.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,p15
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p15
Okay um  so something so a weakness that I found um  and I'm still like working to try to like overcome it is I tend to be long winded in explaining things.,0.4256,0.182,0.737,0.081,p15
Um  it's hard for me to take something that I'm thinking about and communicating it um  concisely um  the first time around.,-0.1027,0.0,0.938,0.062,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Because I feel like I always leave something out after I finish saying it.,0.3182,0.159,0.764,0.076,p15
So I tend to go back and elaborate.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
And then while I'm thinking about it still I'll like talk more about what's coming to mind.,0.3612,0.135,0.865,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  it's something that I've been working on by siding it for things like this.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
And by trying to take up a more prominent role in like the  in like the clubs I'm in and like trying to you know participate more actively in the classes.,0.893,0.328,0.672,0.0,p15
Um  trying to as much as I can to go to um  lab presentations for my year off and speaking- Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
In front of audiences to try to um  make myself less long winded and more precise.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Alright great and last question.,0.7269,0.67,0.33,0.0,p15
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  I think that I can bring I don't know like something  different a new perspective to the table especially coming from MIT.,-0.2755,0.0,0.912,0.088,p15
Um  having had like a very quantitative background.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p15
Um  and given that I've had like extensive experience um  in research um  and my leadership activities on campus  I think that I can bring both the technical skills and um  a way to effectively  hopefully communicate to um  communicate my ideas and bring like a different sort of perspective to your company.,0.8625,0.178,0.822,0.0,p15
And I'm hardworking um  and I always wanna make sure I will do a good job and detail oriented  and um  I just love working with other people on like projects that excite me.,0.9325,0.341,0.659,0.0,p15
So um  that's something that I come from [inaudible] that flatters me is working with people elaborating.,0.1531,0.091,0.909,0.0,p15
And that's um  definitely a skill that I can bring to your company so thank you for your time.,0.7133,0.259,0.741,0.0,p15
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p15
Great  so how are you doing today?,0.6249,0.406,0.594,0.0,p16
Very good  how are you?,0.4927,0.444,0.556,0.0,p16
Great  can you tell me a little bit about yourself?,0.6249,0.313,0.687,0.0,p16
Yea  um so I am junior here at MIT ummm studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments I am really trying to focus on international development.,0.2732,0.068,0.932,0.0,p16
Ummm and because I am interested in either after school going in to either like public health or umm public policy type areas.,0.6369,0.198,0.802,0.0,p16
But both focusing on international development.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Ummm yea  that’s a little bit.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
I'm from right outside of Philadelphia  ummm and I am the uh  second youngest of 3.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Great  all right  so can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.6249,0.24,0.76,0.0,p16
Uh sure  ummm so currently I am actually the co president of an organization here on campus called club med (sp?).,0.3182,0.103,0.897,0.0,p16
And we actually started last year  but last year it was founded by a different person  ummm although I was part of the like founding board  I guess you would say.,0.5023,0.098,0.902,0.0,p16
Ummm and I guess last year  basically what happened was the person who founded it did it for her resume and she wasn't really invested in it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Umm and so basically last year was pretty much a flop  we did  we didn't accomplish much last year.,-0.1361,0.134,0.669,0.198,p16
So this year has been trying to start over ummm as well as trying to take what kind of we felt what was wrong last year and really try to fix those pieces.,-0.25,0.058,0.856,0.086,p16
But also what I really realized from the whole experience is that leadership also needs to recognizes that you are only a leader for a certain amount of time and you really need to be able to kind of set up a situation in which you can set up so someone can transition into your spot.,0.3919,0.046,0.954,0.0,p16
I mean especially in a like college setting  you are going to be the president for a year or maybe two years  ummm and I think what we really learned I think a lot of the struggle we learned from last year is to set up that sort of structure.,0.1189,0.052,0.905,0.043,p16
Also last year there was some tension within the group  just because we were like what are we doing  like why aren't we doing anything  there wasn't a lot of transparency so really trying to emphasize that this year.,0.4019,0.115,0.831,0.053,p16
And we were  so I keep saying we  because co-presidents  it’s my friend Cheri and I  but we are co-presidents  we have been able to expand the club.,0.6187,0.163,0.837,0.0,p16
Last year we had about 14 members  ummm maybe like 10 or less that were truly committed  so now we are at 30 members.,0.738,0.256,0.744,0.0,p16
Which is a really really exciting thing.,0.5819,0.386,0.614,0.0,p16
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,p16
Yea.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Tell me about a time you were working a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,-0.1531,0.136,0.746,0.118,p16
umm that is a good question  umm I think  so freshman year ummm I participated in a program here called terescope (sp?).,0.4404,0.121,0.879,0.0,p16
And it’s a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve.,-0.2263,0.124,0.69,0.186,p16
Ummm kind of like a world problem.,-0.1263,0.223,0.505,0.273,p16
And so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it.,0.2023,0.122,0.878,0.0,p16
Umm and our problem was solving world hunger.,-0.3182,0.198,0.413,0.388,p16
So it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved.,-0.0697,0.257,0.472,0.271,p16
Ummm and what I really learned from  that was a lot about group dynamics I think because it was all freshman led  you had like all these freshman coming from a bunch of schools  where they were the top  they were the ones used to leading everything.,0.6597,0.127,0.873,0.0,p16
I think one of the main problems we had was maybe not necessarily like figuring out the problem  but like figuring out who - how to best organize ourselves  and how to best kind of - ummm when people should step up and be leaders ummm so what I guess learned from that a lot was trying to not necessary like pinpoint one leader  but more like collaborative working together because what like seemed happened when one person stepped up  they necc - they necessary wouldn't be doing a lot  just kind of be like trying to tell people what to do.,0.9687,0.2,0.736,0.063,p16
And that wasn’t effective at all.,0.4767,0.383,0.617,0.0,p16
Instead of just like trying to brainstorm  together problem solve together.,0.1531,0.287,0.533,0.18,p16
Like maybe have someone be one person be more like a facilitator and kind of leading the discussion.,0.6478,0.249,0.751,0.0,p16
Instead of telling people what to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Being like oh this is what you said  and do you want to follow up on that.”  Or like how can we best really tackle that issue.,0.8591,0.313,0.687,0.0,p16
I think what I learned form that what I learned from that  in order to be a leader within a group you need to be asking questions  instead of telling people what to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Giving people more responsibility and and almost have someone be more like.,0.6361,0.342,0.658,0.0,p16
And giving people more responsibility.,0.34,0.375,0.625,0.0,p16
Umm and like make them feel like they are taking ownership versus your putting ownership on them.,0.6124,0.25,0.75,0.0,p16
I think that is what the purpose of the class actually is  to teach you how to work in groups  throughout MIT you work in groups pete (sp?),0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
says  so I think I actually learned a lot from that class  just kind of observing how everything was going on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p16
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p16
Ummm  hmmm  so let's think  so that is a good question.,0.4404,0.225,0.775,0.0,p16
I think sometimes I have trouble working on a project when like  for example when I have too much time right.,-0.0516,0.103,0.785,0.112,p16
So umm for example this summer I was working in DC ummm and I felt like when I wasn't given an exact dead line I didn't necessarily like push myself to work to get it done  because it wasn't -- I didn't  have a dead line like I wasn’t sure when I needed it to get done so I was like oh  that’ fine  okay I can do it later.,0.8314,0.203,0.721,0.076,p16
So I think one of my weaknesses I think it is pushing things off unless there is a deadline.,-0.3612,0.0,0.878,0.122,p16
So I really have been trying setting internal deadlines for myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
And trying to stick to those deadlines  and I think it is really hard  I think it is really hard when you have a lot of things to do to figure out how to prioritize and actually come through with the deadlines.,-0.3369,0.0,0.922,0.078,p16
And I think that is really important skill throughout life.,0.2716,0.189,0.811,0.0,p16
So for example this week I have a lot of things due at the end of the week.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p16
So trying to get at least a certain amount done by Tuesday  and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something I have been trying to work on more.,0.7275,0.197,0.803,0.0,p16
Great  last question - Why do you think we should hire you?,0.6249,0.272,0.728,0.0,p16
Well  we will pretend this is the (inaudible) institute.,0.1779,0.2,0.667,0.133,p16
I am really interested in studying the intersection on nutrition and health  ummm especially in the kind of evaluating project area.,0.4576,0.13,0.87,0.0,p16
So recently I actually switched to economics  umm I was originally studying biology  but I felt that I could - that there is more to be done in economics in terms of helping people and I really would be excited to learn more about how food security and nutrition intersect.,0.8554,0.167,0.833,0.0,p16
And I would be very committed and willing to work as much as you needed me to.,0.3384,0.13,0.87,0.0,p16
Great  thank you.,0.765,0.868,0.132,0.0,p16
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Doing well.,0.2732,0.677,0.323,0.0,p17
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
Alright  so  tell me about yourself.,0.25,0.286,0.714,0.0,p17
Um  my name is Stephie.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Um  I am a junior here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Um  and  see  I'm currently studying Computer Science  so  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
I'm a six three  um  and  I'm here hoping to  you know  get in touch  and um  see if there's any opportunity for me over at Google.,0.6808,0.183,0.817,0.0,p17
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
[inaudible] So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Um  see... Hm  so last semester  um  I took a class in software constructions.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
So it's six double-o five here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
And  um  throughout the semester we had  you know  many individual projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
But  also  two group projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
And  um  something I've noticed very much here at MIT is that people don't like to take initiative and so  um  you know my- we were doing out first group project  and um  you know  my- my partners were pretty cool.,0.5252,0.121,0.833,0.046,p17
But no one seemed to want to arrange a time to meet up and actually get work done.,-0.3291,0.072,0.79,0.138,p17
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
So I jumped in  and you know  shot- shot out a few emails.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
And made it work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
So  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p17
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p17
[laugh] How about that?,0.5574,0.545,0.455,0.0,p17
Um  let's talk about that second group project in this class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
Unfortunately  my  um  my group members in this  uh  for this project were not quite as awesome as the one before.,-0.7096,0.0,0.763,0.237,p17
Um  and  uh  for some reason  um  there were two guys  and  uh  they- they were overriding my code in the repository.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
So  um  they've completely disregarded any work I've done even after I'd emailed them and told them hey  you know  there are tools to help resolve conflicts in code- Mm-hm -if we're both working on the same thing.,-0.0498,0.118,0.759,0.123,p17
And so eventually  I had to go to the TA and to the professor  went spoke to Ann Hunter.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
And they helped me resolve the situation.,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,p17
So  you know  sometimes you try your best in the situation and you really-- some things are out of your control.,0.6369,0.174,0.826,0.0,p17
But  um  usually people you can go to.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
I'm glad that worked out for you.,0.4588,0.333,0.667,0.0,p17
Thanks.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p17
Um  see... I- let's see  I- for the longest time  even when I was small  I've always been pretty quiet.,0.4939,0.144,0.856,0.0,p17
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
So  um  and back in elementary school even.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Uh  on my progress reports they would- they would just say Stephie is- is this sweet girl [laughs] and then  you know  I'd get a mediocre grade for participation  stuff like that.,0.9001,0.3,0.7,0.0,p17
And so that's been an on going struggle for me  um  throughout my life.,-0.3182,0.0,0.85,0.15,p17
But  um  people really aren't as scary as  as sometimes I think they- they seem to be  so.,0.591,0.184,0.816,0.0,p17
It's been going well.,0.2732,0.412,0.588,0.0,p17
Okay  good.,0.5859,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
What have you been doing specifically?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Um  see  uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Well  I've- I've taken classes with  um  with like  speaking components and presentations.,0.5574,0.295,0.705,0.0,p17
Um  so it's  it's a way to get in- my feet into the water.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
But  um  it's been a good experience  so.,0.5927,0.355,0.645,0.0,p17
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p17
Okay  last question.,0.2263,0.487,0.513,0.0,p17
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Hmm  I think that I have a lot to offer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Um  my skill set is  pretty good?,0.7269,0.55,0.45,0.0,p17
Um  you know I've- I've picked up a lot of skills here at MIT and also on my own  um  through research here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p17
And  you know  I think  I can be a valuable asset to  to...,0.6808,0.337,0.663,0.0,p17
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  so I'm a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
I'm majoring in environmental engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Mmhmm Um  and so I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology  environmental transport.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  I've done internships previously with environmental restoration companies.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
And I also participated in research last summer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Career goals?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  I'd like to go to Grad school after I graduate in Environmental Enginneering again.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,p20
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  so this semester I became President of the Women's Independent Living Group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
Um  after being House Manager last semester.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
So I've worked through a lot of problems within the house in trying to kind of get the right atmosphere in the house.,-0.4019,0.0,0.891,0.109,p20
Can you be a little bit more specific?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  So as house manager  um  I organized work week at the beginning of this year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
So it's a time when - there's about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and  um  works on the house  paints rooms  like fixes it up before the school year starts.,0.3612,0.07,0.93,0.0,p20
So I organized that  assigned jobs to people and facilitated that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Okay  great.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p20
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p20
Um  so I'm also on the rowing team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
And I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for  but I guess  I was in the second boat last year and we were having a lot of problems throughout the season kind of like we would go to a race and we would be okay  but we weren't performing up to our standards.,0.0334,0.083,0.836,0.081,p20
And so it was a big struggle for me to try and figure out how to kind of help turn the attitude around in the boat.,0.0276,0.084,0.836,0.08,p20
Um  and we were finally able to pull it off in our very last race and we won the semi-finals at Patriot League.,0.5719,0.144,0.856,0.0,p20
So I think it's the right mix of like knowing when to speak up say something and knowing what to say.,0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,p20
So the way you change the attitude was by?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down  but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had.,-0.1419,0.0,0.946,0.054,p20
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p20
Um  one of my weaknesses  I tend to be  I guess  a little more withdrawn sometimes.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p20
Um  and that's something I've been working on like I've taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team  um  but I think something good about that is I tend to be a very good listener.,0.8717,0.225,0.775,0.0,p20
Mmhmm And then I'm starting to learn when to speak up and become more of a like up-front role.,0.4144,0.133,0.867,0.0,p20
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
And last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Um  I think I'm like extremely responsible.,0.624,0.505,0.495,0.0,p20
Mmhmm Um  I have a lot of experience.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
And this is something that I think will help further my career goals and something I'm really excited about learning about.,0.659,0.221,0.779,0.0,p20
And so I'll put a lot of effort into this project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p20
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p20
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Um  pretty good.,0.7269,0.859,0.141,0.0,p21
Um   yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p21
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p21
So tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
So  um  my name is Dina Wong.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
I'm a student at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
I'm in my third year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
I'm majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um  biologic-um  Computational Biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Um It's pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year.,0.7152,0.374,0.626,0.0,p21
Oh wow So yeah  so I've been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes.,0.7695,0.323,0.677,0.0,p21
Um in my free time I like to  um  write for the Tech and a be edit  um articles at the  um the student newspaper  for the student newspaper.,0.7003,0.177,0.823,0.0,p21
Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running  stuff like that.,0.8402,0.455,0.545,0.0,p21
Great what are your career goals.,0.6249,0.451,0.549,0.0,p21
So currently I'm looking for an internship for the summer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Um  I actually um  I'm exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate.,0.8957,0.223,0.777,0.0,p21
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p21
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
So tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
So a what happens is  um  like um  for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time.,0.743,0.241,0.759,0.0,p21
mhm So  um  one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um  column for for the campus life section.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
So there was a um  the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life.,0.4215,0.147,0.853,0.0,p21
And so um  I negotiated with her to like um  sort to arrange how the column would work  because like um  I guess we both had the same like um  intent of how we should like publish articles  but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she  if your original idea was that she wanted to  I could  it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um  people like  like the Tech is a newspaper you don’t like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um  write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey.,0.9744,0.224,0.757,0.02,p21
Ok great.,0.743,1.0,0.0,0.0,p21
So  tell me about a time you were on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p21
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p21
Hmm  Ah...Um I guess again probably using um  let me see..ok so I guess again on  for the Tech cause it's like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular.,0.7152,0.181,0.819,0.0,p21
Um  I guess um  what happened was um  shit  um I really don’t know how to answer these type of questions sorry.,-0.5994,0.0,0.803,0.197,p21
It's ok  take your time.,0.296,0.355,0.645,0.0,p21
Um... It doesn't necessarily be extracurricular either.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Um...Ok I guess I'll go back to high school then.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
So in high school I was on the cross country team and um  so what happened was we a like we're  we're competing right so we um  so we had to like  um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the  um so there's a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was  i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um  and the girls team was like less motivated and wha  and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut  take short cuts and stuff like that.,0.9757,0.226,0.725,0.048,p21
Um  I guess what happened was my um  there was another student on the team who was also  who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um  could you not do that?,0.8805,0.196,0.804,0.0,p21
but eventually what happened was I guess we  me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way  like I mean there's  there's motivating people  but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess that's what happened.,0.9493,0.258,0.742,0.0,p21
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p21
So can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p21
OK  Um  I would  let me think.,0.4466,0.328,0.672,0.0,p21
One of my  I guess one weakness I have is um  well MIT is full of smart people right.,0.25,0.203,0.678,0.119,p21
Um  if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff  so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like I'm not as at their level.,0.9501,0.325,0.675,0.0,p21
So um  I guess what I try  what I try to do is like I  I was  feeling badly  but then I realized.,-0.0129,0.12,0.798,0.082,p21
Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere.,0.2732,0.174,0.826,0.0,p21
I've been like training my own skills like  reach up to the  to learn more in depth and eventually I'll get that good  just takes like practice and I've also been like just sort of telling myself that it's  to like just apply to things and like don’t  and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right.,0.9119,0.259,0.695,0.046,p21
So make like um  project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come.,0.8214,0.398,0.602,0.0,p21
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p21
And last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p21
Well um  so I've been learning a lot about um  computer science since I was here.,0.2732,0.123,0.877,0.0,p21
I've um  I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything  getting thing in time  on deadline.,0.887,0.314,0.686,0.0,p21
Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I  and not procrastinate or anything like that.,0.6124,0.167,0.833,0.0,p21
Um I'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um  I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a  I would be able to produce um  good products.,0.9633,0.327,0.673,0.0,p21
Great,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p21
Ready?,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
I'm good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,p22
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Um  I'm a junior in aerospace engineering  um  I'm originally from Kansas City  um  and I was born on the East Coast.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
I'm currently deciding whether or not I want to go into aerospace industry or go into consulting or another aviation-related field.,-0.0572,0.0,0.942,0.058,p22
I'm minoring in management.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
[pause] So  can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Uh  so  right now I'm actually quite involved with the Global Poverty Initiative here at MIT  and I'm currently the director of ACTION under GPI  Global Poverty Initiative  so I'm currently in charge of the projects we are involved with abroad  so that includes projects in Mexico  service projects in Central Mexico... Um-hmm.,-0.765,0.0,0.885,0.115,p22
...as well as a project with a domestic..an NGO in India that works with domestic workers in setting up domestic workers with local employers  and training women  and working with employer-employee relationships.,0.2732,0.063,0.937,0.0,p22
Um  most of my work has been on the Mexico project  and I led a team -- I actually have traveled down three times -- and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now  and I oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built fourteen greenhouses as well as conducted classes at the secondary school as well as classes for adults in both computers and English.,0.4939,0.054,0.946,0.0,p22
Uh  and we worked with NGOs on the ground  um  and they've actually managed to continue our projects since we've been gone  uh  as well as working with the Peace Corps  and  uh  they've actually recently decided to send a full-time Peace Corps volunteer to the rural community where we were working  so... Great.,0.9217,0.209,0.791,0.0,p22
...that was really validating.,0.4005,0.473,0.527,0.0,p22
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
So  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p22
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p22
Um  well  most of the challenges that I've faced with a team have been with my projects in Mexico.,0.3947,0.177,0.823,0.0,p22
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Um  so  probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members  because when we went there  we had originally thought -- we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and bio-digesters  which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste -- and when we got there  we talked to lots of community members.,0.3612,0.089,0.872,0.039,p22
First of all  they can be rather skeptical of outsides coming in  so we first had to earn their trust  and we had to establish that we weren't going to  um  just come in and give them something and leave.,0.2023,0.075,0.845,0.08,p22
This wasn't going to be a hand-out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
So it was interesting being the leader within my group and trying to help those who had not had the same experiences with other cultures and working with people across borders  so helping those people adjust as well as working that relationship between  you know  rural Mexicans who have limited experience with outsiders and are used to either government hand-outs or people coming in and doing one thing and leaving  and not following up.,0.8285,0.13,0.846,0.023,p22
So that's was a challenge  but in the end  we ended up using community feedback to determine which project we wanted to do.,0.0387,0.05,0.95,0.0,p22
So  they were most interested in greenhouses as well as some [?],0.624,0.337,0.663,0.0,p22
small business  so we ended up catering to both of those project ideas.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
The way that we decided to work around the not wanting to seem like we were giving a hand-out  we actually had all the families build their own greenhouses with our help.,0.765,0.208,0.792,0.0,p22
So we distributed all the materials and then had them pay small deposits so they would have some small investment into the project.,-0.1027,0.0,0.94,0.06,p22
Obviously they couldn't afford to pay for the whole thing.,0.0762,0.126,0.874,0.0,p22
Um  then we worked with each individual family  and they built it and made it their own  and so they had a bigger incentive to take care of it.,0.6908,0.174,0.826,0.0,p22
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p22
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
Sometimes I can be disorganized.,-0.296,0.0,0.645,0.355,p22
I mean  I think everyone struggles with that a little bit  but the way I try to deal with that...recently I've taken to becoming a list person.,-0.1901,0.0,0.937,0.063,p22
[laughs] In order for me to ensure that I get things done -- I always get things done  but  you know  when you leave things for the last minute  sometimes the quality of your work is not always the best.,-0.4501,0.085,0.787,0.128,p22
So  to deal with this  I've tried to break down all the problems and break down my tasks into small steps  make lists  and then set separate deadlines for each individual thing  knowing that if I have things that come up and everything is all due at the same time  everything needs to be done at once  I can handle that.,-0.4019,0.0,0.957,0.043,p22
And also I've learned that it's important to delegate your tasks  especially with GPI.,0.2023,0.122,0.878,0.0,p22
Being director of ACTION  a lot of responsibility falls on me and it can be very easy to be  like  Oh  yeah  I need to take care of this and talk to these people  but that's why I have a team.,0.6753,0.169,0.831,0.0,p22
There are 20 people on GPI ACTION  so in order to delegate those tasks  it makes my life easier and keeps those other people involved.,0.4215,0.104,0.896,0.0,p22
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
Last question: Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
I think I have a diverse skill set  and I have very diverse background working with other cultures  not only in Mexico  but I've had experiences in Europe and in China.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
I'm bi-racial myself  and I think I have a very unique background  and especially as an engineer who's interested in going into consulting  and I have work experience at Space-X and NASA and  um  other companies.,0.4019,0.072,0.928,0.0,p22
I think I offer very unique perspective into what your company culture would be.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p22
And I think that's very important  in not having everyone have the same background and everyone in your community...you need different perspectives  and I think I would definitely help fill that.,0.7574,0.211,0.789,0.0,p22
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p22
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
I'm doing very well.,0.3384,0.444,0.556,0.0,p24
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
I'm currently a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
I'm studying biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Ummm I am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine  but I don't know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side  but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that.,0.9127,0.245,0.755,0.0,p24
So  within the broader field but I'm not sure specifically what path yet.,-0.3491,0.0,0.831,0.169,p24
Okay  great.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Umm  okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p24
So umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school I actually went on a leadership trip.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to Israel for the summer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Wow  okay.,0.6908,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
And it was the first time I'd ever been  which was very exciting um.,0.5413,0.212,0.788,0.0,p24
And it was a very cool experience 'cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills  but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like  'someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water.',0.8819,0.181,0.819,0.0,p24
Right  right right right right right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
And  you know  make sure the group's staying together and things like that  um.,0.5859,0.286,0.714,0.0,p24
So that was definitely something that I think impacted me a lot.,0.4522,0.212,0.788,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
And I think  you know  in other leadership roles  you know  even in a small group project or something.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
A lot of the time I find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying  'Okay  we were in a tough spot like that before.',0.4404,0.147,0.803,0.05,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
'How did we kinda rally the group back together?'.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Something like that.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,p24
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
And can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,p24
What did you do to solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.171,0.571,0.257,p24
Umm  sure.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p24
So  a time when I was working on a team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
So I think  um  this situation arises a lot of times in lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
So I was  um  this past summer I was back in Israel and working in a lab at the Hebrew University.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Um  and it was a pretty small lab.,0.4939,0.314,0.686,0.0,p24
I was working um for one of the post-ocs and then there are about four other people in the lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
And so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of  'Okay  we don't have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment.,0.5829,0.162,0.838,0.0,p24
Can I borrow this from this lab?',0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
'Can someone check down the hall  if maybe they have this?',0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done.,0.3182,0.133,0.867,0.0,p24
Um and then it was also interesting 'cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab.,0.4019,0.119,0.881,0.0,p24
Oh  okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p24
Um 'cause there were some Israelis that were working there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
And then one of the PhD students was from Russia  and then two of the post-ocs were from India.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Um and so the common language among them was English  but in sort of a broken-down manner in different ways.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
So that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating English to English for people Right  right right.,0.5594,0.141,0.859,0.0,p24
And checking emails and making sure they made sense  and things like that.,0.5859,0.304,0.696,0.0,p24
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p24
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
Uh  I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side.,-0.25,0.0,0.875,0.125,p24
Especially um like if I'm the person coming into a new group or a new experience.,0.4173,0.156,0.844,0.0,p24
And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like  there's a reason why I'm here.,0.3612,0.128,0.872,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
And I can add something to the experience  even if it's not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Like for example  the lab last summer  I was the only undergraduate working there.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,p24
And so that kind of brought out that shyer side.,-0.2023,0.0,0.833,0.167,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
'Cause I walked in and  you know  everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Um  so just kind of keep  keeping up the reminders that like  'I'm here to get something out of this experience and hopefully I can help out the lab  while at the same time realizing that  you know  I'm not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today.,0.7845,0.144,0.856,0.0,p24
And that's okay.',0.2263,0.487,0.513,0.0,p24
Mhmm  mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
'And  you know  I still need to feel comfortable here; I need to add what I can  and then the rest will fall into place when it does.',0.5106,0.109,0.891,0.0,p24
And I think just  you know  keeping those reminders coming that I don't have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back  relax; see what I  what I can add to the table without freaking out that it's not enough.,0.753,0.169,0.786,0.045,p24
Okay  great.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
And  last question: Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Um  I think for me where I'm  where I am at this point  where I'm deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route; Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
The more time I spend in a hospital setting I think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if it's the one-on-one patient care that I care more about  or if it's the sort of overarching like how are these people being cured more from a scientific standpoint?,0.8836,0.191,0.809,0.0,p24
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p24
Um  and I think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot.,0.4019,0.13,0.87,0.0,p24
Because you know it's always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level.,0.4404,0.127,0.873,0.0,p24
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
And someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two.,0.4588,0.15,0.85,0.0,p24
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p24
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
I'm good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,p25
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
I'm doing well.,0.2732,0.512,0.488,0.0,p25
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
I'm a core 16 here at MIT  which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
I'm a junior.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
And my experience has been last summer I worked with NASA Glenn Research Center doing  ah  interplanetary rover work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
I was.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um doing design work with Jeff Landis as my mentor.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
So  ah  yeah I had a really good time working on that project.,0.688,0.34,0.66,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Doing a lot of (inaudible) coding.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Making a lot of design decisions.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
As well as ah separately working on a project with just my fellow interns where we  um  where we built a autonomous navigation system for a Dropsonde.,0.2732,0.075,0.925,0.0,p25
Um which is a meteorological measuring device.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um but we didn't worry about the Dropsonde itself  we were just concerned with building a navigation system.,0.4782,0.155,0.845,0.0,p25
Mm hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
So  that it could be recovered by  um  the people who are using it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  and I personally worked on the steerable para-foil parachute for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
So can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
I can.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
When we were working on the Dropsonde project which I mentioned before  um  there was um  some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it.,0.2023,0.081,0.861,0.058,p25
Um  because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time.,0.2023,0.073,0.927,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
So  it was fairly...it takes um  not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
So we had to find a really good drop location.,0.2058,0.235,0.589,0.175,p25
Mm hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
And we were having a lot of trouble with that.,-0.4019,0.0,0.769,0.231,p25
And  um  we...we were pursuing some options with working with NASA  um  but it didn't look like they were gonna work out.,-0.395,0.0,0.887,0.113,p25
And I took the initiative  um  and I went and I contact the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously there in the summer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
So we'd like spoken the owner there before  but not like  not about anything official.,-0.1964,0.108,0.741,0.152,p25
We just said hi  we've skydived at your airport.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
But  I called him  talked to him about it  um  and got actually um  a plane and a free flight for our time to go and be able to drop our (inaudible) um project  which was pretty significant for the success of the project.,0.9366,0.278,0.676,0.046,p25
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
And tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p25
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p25
Well I guess I should probably pick a different time that I was working on a team.,0.2732,0.116,0.884,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
So  um  when..for the Venus rover  which was the other project that I worked on last summer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  we had  um  we basically started just with with nothing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  because  um  this  this idea's really like in early design phases.,0.4201,0.202,0.798,0.0,p25
It's not like..there's no Venus rover being built by any team.,0.2235,0.159,0.841,0.0,p25
It's just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a Venus rover.,0.3612,0.128,0.872,0.0,p25
Um  so there's a flexibility there.,0.3947,0.348,0.652,0.0,p25
Lot of room to sort of um figure out what we thought would work out best.,0.6369,0.219,0.781,0.0,p25
And initially there is  um  there are two basically competing ideas.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  there was the idea of using  ahh  wind turbine  um  to power the rover.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Verses having actually be a land sailer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
And  I mean there was no clear answer regarding which one of those was better.,0.1818,0.16,0.719,0.121,p25
The wind turbine had some advantage in that it would be able to sit and charge  what would the term...the....it would be able to sit still and um  accumulate power as the wind blew on it so it wouldn't have to be moving constantly.,0.25,0.044,0.956,0.0,p25
Um  where is the land sailer would have to have some threshold level of wind to move to work (inaudible) friction.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
It didn't have that then it wouldn't be able to do anything useful.,0.4404,0.195,0.805,0.0,p25
Um  so in that way the turbine seemed a little bit less risky  but a turbine also has more moving parts.,-0.0314,0.0,0.947,0.053,p25
Um  and it would require a little bit more on the electronics side and that's riskier as well.,-0.0772,0.102,0.78,0.117,p25
Um  so it was...um  so yeah  it was not a clear decision.,0.1735,0.19,0.664,0.145,p25
Um  and  basically the team was split between wanting to do the turbine wanting to do the land sailer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  so  what we ended up doing was  um  we...I was pro turbine so I ended up doing an analysis of the wind turbine.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  and my fellow intern was pro land sailer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Did a analysis of the land sailer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um  neither of us did anything super in depth.,0.5994,0.328,0.672,0.0,p25
But we just did  the um a basic analysis and then we compared our numbers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
We looked through each others processes.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um made sure that we were sort of working from the same assumptions.,0.3182,0.161,0.839,0.0,p25
Um  which we were  I mean cause I mean we both like did an honest job with it.,0.7003,0.266,0.734,0.0,p25
Um  and then we just went based on the math.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Which one seemed like it was gonna work out better.,0.6597,0.403,0.597,0.0,p25
Um  so it ended up being non confrontational.,-0.3818,0.0,0.729,0.271,p25
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
And which ended up working better?,0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0,p25
The turbine did.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Which I was happy about.,0.5719,0.481,0.519,0.0,p25
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
I am not extremely well organized.,-0.2572,0.0,0.711,0.289,p25
Um  so  ahh  yeah.,0.3566,0.452,0.548,0.0,p25
My ...my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and I have trouble meeting deadlines.,-0.6369,0.0,0.755,0.245,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
But I ...um  overcome it just by recognizing something that....recognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and I will miss deadlines if I don't really pay attention to it.,-0.0337,0.047,0.903,0.05,p25
Um  so  I do writing down deadlines keeping a Google calendar.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Trying to keep myself on top of things.,0.2023,0.205,0.795,0.0,p25
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
I think you should hire me because  um  I am intelligent and hard working.,0.3818,0.183,0.732,0.085,p25
Um  and I think...I think my grades at MIT really prove that I am intelligent and hard working.,0.3818,0.147,0.784,0.069,p25
Um  and  I think that  as well as that I also have the experience that you would want at JPO.,0.34,0.159,0.841,0.0,p25
Working on interplanetary rovers  I've done that before.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p25
Also worked on teams um  to try to accomplish goals.,0.4215,0.237,0.763,0.0,p25
Um  so I think that really I am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position.,0.6486,0.275,0.725,0.0,p25
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p25
How are you doing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
I'm doing well thank you.,0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,p27
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p27
Can you tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Um  I'm currently a junior studying chemistry in biology  at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
I'm primarily interested in biochemistry research  pacifically  how small molecules interact with the body  um  and produce physiological effects.,0.4019,0.13,0.87,0.0,p27
MmmHmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
I've done research as an undergraduate  um  in the lab that's chemistry and biological  um  engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
So I've been able to work at a chemical  biology interface.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p27
Okay  so tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership.,0.2263,0.174,0.826,0.0,p27
I've demonstrated leadership through my role in dorm's house government.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p27
I've been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Um  so through that I've been able to work with others  and um  work with the  like  other members of house government as well as the administration.,0.5574,0.155,0.845,0.0,p27
Um  and bring  um  concerns from residents to the administration  and represent them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p27
Tell me about a time where you were on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p27
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p27
I've um  been able to work on teams  um  during my undergraduate classes  we  um  in our laboratory classes in the chemistry department we generally work  um  in small groups of two or three.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
So there's definitely been challenges in those situations where  for example  team member accidentally does something wrong  like  cost us a lot of product  or makes our experiment go wrong  and I found it helpful to kind of  be like  able to put  you know  aside my annoying side when someone's done in the moment  and figure how to move forward.,-0.0571,0.16,0.69,0.15,p27
Mmmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Um  as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently  try to see how to go forward with that.,-0.5267,0.0,0.866,0.134,p27
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p27
I would say my weakness is actually leadership experience  because I haven't had a lot of it.,-0.4215,0.0,0.851,0.149,p27
Um  I also haven't had much experience working in a team environment  but I have been seeking out opportunities to improve this  um  looking for even more of a role in house government this year  um  and actually running for house president.,0.8047,0.153,0.847,0.0,p27
How soon to try to get a leadership position.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
So I'm trying to more experience in those areas.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p27
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
I think you should hire me because I bring experience from  um  from my education at M.I.T.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p27
which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment  to work hard and be able to solve problems  and I've demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that I've already done.,-0.2975,0.097,0.753,0.151,p27
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p27
Um how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Good thanks.,0.7003,1.0,0.0,0.0,p29
tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Um I'm a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Um I'm majoring in biological engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
I play for the women's varsity volleyball team at MIT.,0.34,0.211,0.789,0.0,p29
Um and also then also fairly involved with my sorority at MIT alpha phi.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
I'm the vice president of the chapter of operations so I'm pretty involved with the house maintenance and things like that.,0.7165,0.239,0.761,0.0,p29
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p29
Tell me how you've demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Um I think my most active role in leadership would be within my sorority um it's my job to make sure that everything is operating smoothly so thats includes coordinating with our chef like meals that are working  that all our facilities including our washers and driers and everything are up and running.,0.7778,0.135,0.865,0.0,p29
We've had like issues with refrigerators.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,p29
Um like last year when the power went off there was a lot of issues with that  that we had to kind of adjust so I think I being being able to maintain calm and like make sure everything was dealt with a timely and efficient manner.,0.886,0.228,0.772,0.0,p29
Tell me about a time when working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.091,0.909,0.0,p29
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p29
Um so the obvious team choice would be my volleyball team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p29
Um and we actually get along pretty well so there's not too many conflicts.,0.7568,0.405,0.595,0.0,p29
But I think this is silly as it sounds.,0.0387,0.126,0.874,0.0,p29
One of the things is what we eat after meals or after games.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Um and so I think it's kind of nice sometimes I'll just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games.,0.3626,0.067,0.933,0.0,p29
And so that way I kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what we're gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team.,0.8402,0.161,0.839,0.0,p29
Like what would you like to do after the game?,0.6124,0.385,0.615,0.0,p29
And getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
I'm getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that.,0.7579,0.283,0.717,0.0,p29
So uh I think that way it's just being able to get a couple of different opinions  come to a conclusion before um making a decision.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
That's been pretty successful.,0.7906,0.778,0.222,0.0,p29
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p29
And tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.865,0.135,p29
one of my weaknesses might be um maybe voicing my opinion all the time.,-0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,p29
Sometimes if I'm in a group with a lot of like loud personalities I might have um an opinion on a matter but not always want to voice it in the most.,0.1197,0.085,0.875,0.04,p29
I won't um word my feelings in the best way or be able to convey exactly my emotions um so I think working to do that and I think just through getting more leadership exposure and really pushing myself to get out there has been helping me overcome that.,0.7506,0.12,0.88,0.0,p29
I think that from freshman to now junior year that it definitely by taking more leadership roles on I've been able to become more vocal person to kind of like express my concerns.,0.6003,0.137,0.863,0.0,p29
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p29
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
I think you should hire me because I think I have a lot of uh technical or skills both um like bases off of my academic performance s. I would have good but also more I feel like I work well with others.,0.84,0.204,0.796,0.0,p29
I'm able to take initiative and if there's ever some sort of concern I've never had a pro with people coming to me to discuss it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p29
Um I think I'm good at recognizing problems early before they get too uh become a good a big problem.,0.1027,0.213,0.588,0.199,p29
Um and kind of address them in a very professional manner and fix it um the problem can go over smoothly.,-0.4019,0.0,0.881,0.119,p29
So  uhh  how are you doing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p3
You?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I’m well.,0.2732,0.677,0.323,0.0,p3
Thanks for coming.,0.4404,0.592,0.408,0.0,p3
Yeah  sorry  I was- think I was late.,0.2263,0.232,0.632,0.137,p3
I totally  like  messed up.,0.0296,0.33,0.354,0.316,p3
I thought we were at the media lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
But .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
It’s ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
So please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p3
Ahh  hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
So  uhh  I would- would say that the job I’m interviewing for  let’s stay down here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
So  yeay   I’m Chase  and I guess  um  I don’t know.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I really enjoy computers and outdoors  that’s -that’s generally what I give people.,0.5413,0.225,0.775,0.0,p3
Um  so in both of these  um  in computers mainly  uhh  at MIT I think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics .,0.4588,0.111,0.889,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
and computational photography as well.,0.2732,0.344,0.656,0.0,p3
So it’s actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems.,0.0754,0.191,0.637,0.172,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Um  like really deep programming like C  I’m actually getting more interested in.,0.8051,0.452,0.548,0.0,p3
Whereas before when I came to MIT I had no idea about this stuff and I just did a lot of web-development.,-0.296,0.0,0.905,0.095,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  otherwise I just .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I really just enjoy working on random projects.,0.539,0.332,0.668,0.0,p3
Going to Aca-thons [SP?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
a lot and hanging out with people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p3
Just building cool things.,0.3182,0.434,0.566,0.0,p3
Uhh  otherwise  uhh  my main thing I do afterwards is ultimate Frisbee  which I really enjoy.,0.5413,0.189,0.811,0.0,p3
OK  cool.,0.6408,1.0,0.0,0.0,p3
Uhh  so  uhh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Uhh  actually that would probably be .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I would actually put this on Frisbee.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
[laughs] Uhh  so I started the Frisbee club in my high school  um  my junior year.,0.4939,0.176,0.824,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
And  umm  basically it was just a bunch of my friends.,0.4767,0.237,0.763,0.0,p3
We used to play around a lot  and we said  “Hey  why don’t we just make this a team?” It was about 15 or 20 of us.,0.34,0.085,0.915,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  so I became captain and what that entailed was getting people to practices every day or maybe three times a week  depending on  like  how people’s schedules were.,0.3612,0.082,0.918,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
But it was definitely tricky because  I mean  we had to get  you know  at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game  because you need 7 on each side.,0.6956,0.156,0.799,0.045,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  so  uhh  getting all this organized like everyday was umm  definitely like pretty hard to do.,0.8591,0.449,0.494,0.058,p3
And I had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play.,0.802,0.325,0.675,0.0,p3
Umm  and by the end  uhh  we went to a tournament in Texas .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.which is where I’m from.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  and we got 5th my junior year and 3rd my senior year which is great without a coach or anything.,0.6249,0.17,0.83,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah.,0.7269,0.47,0.53,0.0,p3
So tell me about a time you were on a team and were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p3
How did you overcome it?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Uhh  hmm  OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
So let’s- let’s go with robotics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
That was one of the classes I was in  uhh  last semester.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
So  umm  basically  uhh  the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
And figuring out  umm  you know  just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it  doing vision and such.,0.5423,0.158,0.842,0.0,p3
Umm  so finally at the very end of the  umm  uhh  class we had to make our own robots.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
And so what I did there  umm  basically  uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  and I guess  uhh  what I wanted to do was  umm  basically go ahead with everything we’d already done.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Uhh  and just push forward with that and just finish off basically.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
And what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  so what we ended up doing  I actually took their side  umm  and it worked out very well.,0.3384,0.117,0.883,0.0,p3
Umm  we had  uhh  quite a few tricky problems involved like  umm  uhh  one really cool thing we worked on was figuring out exactly  umm  how the robot can see the world .,0.1354,0.132,0.75,0.118,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
and what we had with this  we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with.,-0.5563,0.0,0.817,0.183,p3
We had a tile floor and then walls .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
everywhere.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  so what we were able to do is say  “Let’s just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops.” Huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
“So let’s look at all the light in the picture and whenever we don’t see any white  that’s actually the bottom of the wall.” Ahh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p3
So then we basically took all these points that existed  that represented roughly the bottom of the wall  and then basically ran that through an algorhythm that created it  uhh  turned it into a line.,0.25,0.056,0.944,0.0,p3
Umm  so yeah.,0.3597,0.555,0.445,0.0,p3
That was- that was kind of what it was and it worked really well.,0.3384,0.155,0.845,0.0,p3
In the end we actually had this vision turned on which is really tricky and .,0.0918,0.124,0.772,0.104,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Ohh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I think the first time they’d actually had  umm  some- something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning.,0.3612,0.102,0.898,0.0,p3
Umm  actually local- relocalization in the world.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Ahh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p3
So tell me about one of your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p3
OK  uhh  hmm.,0.4466,0.595,0.405,0.0,p3
One of my weaknesses?,-0.3612,0.0,0.545,0.455,p3
Umm  I would go with  umm  .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
umm .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.Yeah I should’ve had a better answer for this question .,0.6249,0.362,0.638,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.umm  I guess .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I don’t know if I can plan to overcome it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
[laughing] I don’t know.,0.4939,0.516,0.484,0.0,p3
You can pick anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I- I- I’d actually say  umm  I- I wish I was a lot better in working- in working in teams.,0.6808,0.237,0.763,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  so  I actually really enjoy working in teams in general and that’s  umm  actually been one of my biggest focuses at MIT because I just know everyone is like really great at everything.,0.8856,0.251,0.749,0.0,p3
Umm  but being able to  umm  basically inspire people to do stuff that I think is a good idea.,0.872,0.344,0.656,0.0,p3
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Uhh  I have found that I’m not the best at basically.,-0.5216,0.0,0.748,0.252,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  uhh  I mean just like  just- just various aspects of just everything.,0.3612,0.172,0.828,0.0,p3
You know  like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know  I’ve got like various ideas that I need to get across to people but sometimes people don’t agree with me and .,0.6428,0.146,0.822,0.032,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas.,0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  so  I guess- I guess my plan to overcome this  uhh  so far has basically just been a lot of practice .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Uhh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
and just doing more  uhh  basically again  like I’ve been doing a lot of teamwork in general.,0.3612,0.135,0.865,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
I do really enjoy it.,0.5413,0.466,0.534,0.0,p3
So I think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me  umm  so hopefully I can inspire others.,0.9267,0.343,0.657,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Now why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  [laughs] uhh  I guess because  umm  I- I would probably say the one word comes down to passion.,0.7351,0.267,0.733,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  I- whatever I’m doing  I make sure  umm  to do it with everything that I have and I’m- I’m basically always thinking about the problems that I’m working on.,-0.1027,0.07,0.848,0.082,p3
Umm I- I- I generally have like a pretty small scope of problems as well  that I always try to narrow it down.,0.6249,0.264,0.644,0.092,p3
I’m not- I can’t take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them.,-0.2911,0.083,0.781,0.137,p3
If I’m reading a book  I’m only reading like one or two books.,0.3612,0.172,0.828,0.0,p3
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Umm  but with this  umm  I don’t know I- I- I’ve found it so far to be really helpful.,0.6297,0.187,0.813,0.0,p3
Umm  I think my passion generally overflows to other people.,0.4588,0.25,0.75,0.0,p3
Umm  I- I think I’m frequently jumping around  uhh  when I’m doing stuff .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
and like explaining stuff and like listening to people.,0.6124,0.417,0.583,0.0,p3
Umm  so I think I- I- I bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes- I’m always looking at new stuff  learning new stuff and- and teaching people about it  umm  and you know just enjoy making stuff.,0.8519,0.189,0.811,0.0,p3
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,p3
‘Preciate your interviewing with us today.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p3
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Pretty well.,0.6486,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
Um  tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Um  I'm Nikki.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I'm a course 6 major at MIT this year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I live at east campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Um  what do you want to know?,0.0772,0.178,0.822,0.0,p30
Oh  great!,0.6588,0.815,0.185,0.0,p30
I'm from Minnesota... Tell me about how a time you've demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Um...um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I was in APO.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I was the fellowship vice president for a time.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
I was responsible for organizing the [xx?]...,0.3182,0.277,0.723,0.0,p30
basically it's limited to three sections.,-0.2263,0.0,0.725,0.275,p30
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
Friendship  leadership and service.,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,p30
It was on my [xx?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
organizing the events that...helped to foster friendship among the brothers.,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,p30
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
So tell about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p30
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p30
So we had this project a few weeks ago... Okay.,0.2263,0.174,0.826,0.0,p30
It was a [xx?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
of [xx?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
and one of our group-mates did the whole thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Oh  wow!,0.6239,0.804,0.196,0.0,p30
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
Okay  so... Um.,0.2263,0.487,0.513,0.0,p30
So we...the other two of us we talked among ourselves to figure out what like had happened exactly  because both of us are just kind of [xx?],0.3612,0.088,0.912,0.0,p30
really quickly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
And then arranged a meeting with the TA [xx?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
to see if we could work out a solution and at the end it worked out okay.,0.4939,0.219,0.781,0.0,p30
It wasn't the best  obviously  because we hadn't gotten to do the work.,-0.5216,0.0,0.781,0.219,p30
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Resolved it.,0.1779,0.63,0.37,0.0,p30
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
I haven't had this kind of interview in forever....I'm going to ask you to code.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Um  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.872,0.128,p30
I'm really quiet.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Oh  okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p30
I just speak really quietly and it's because in my head it sounds louder than I guess it is.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Oh  okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p30
I work on it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I try to project and all that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I ask people to tell me if I'm being too quiet  cause I can't [xx?].,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
It's a real problem though.,-0.4019,0.0,0.597,0.403,p30
Okay  and last question.,0.2263,0.388,0.612,0.0,p30
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
For what?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Uhm  because I learn really quickly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p30
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
I bring a very positive attitude to the job and I like to have fun with what I do.,0.8655,0.377,0.623,0.0,p30
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
And I work hard at it and I don't what to let people down [xx?,-0.1027,0.0,0.909,0.091,p30
].,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p30
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Ready?,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Yep.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Uh  well I'm a Junior.,0.2732,0.344,0.656,0.0,p31
I'm an MIT student.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Um  I'm majoring in both Math and Computer Science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about?,0.25,0.133,0.867,0.0,p31
Oh just like a general idea of what your interests are and like you know what kind of goals you're looking for in terms of the future.,0.7184,0.226,0.774,0.0,p31
Cool  well I'm really interested in distributed systems actually and that's more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing.,0.8553,0.251,0.749,0.0,p31
Um  I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform.,0.1779,0.061,0.939,0.0,p31
I'm also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Well  uh  this was in high school but in high school I was the  uh  president of our robotics team as well as the  uh  in the earlier years the head of  respectively the  the  uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team.,0.743,0.151,0.849,0.0,p31
Uh  and you know that was a good leadership experience uh  I've also been in  uh  in 6172 we have group projects - they're only two people - but um  in some of the projects I've been the person doing a lot of the organizing.,0.2382,0.042,0.958,0.0,p31
Uh  yeah  um.,0.296,0.524,0.476,0.0,p31
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p31
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p31
Are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in a working with people challenge?,0.7264,0.403,0.597,0.0,p31
I mean any situation where you're working with people and there is an issue.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Well  um  in my 6172 class I'm taking right now I was working with Jason.,0.2732,0.13,0.87,0.0,p31
He is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness um  of improvement.,0.926,0.305,0.695,0.0,p31
And we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately five hundredfold.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Yeah  it was pretty intense.,0.6908,0.77,0.23,0.0,p31
And we as such like had to sort of try and paralyze the work and you know it was pretty hard because the code - like  merging two code documents is never fun and there was really only one document we were working on.,0.6246,0.16,0.76,0.08,p31
What ended up happening is that I spent most of the time uh driving which is to say coding  him watching - verifying my algorithm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
It was stressful because it was getting close to the deadline and if we didn't finish this optimization we'd have to turn in an old version which was only ten times faster as opposed to five hundred times faster.,-0.0772,0.069,0.855,0.076,p31
We ended up getting it not five hundred times faster  but one hundred times faster.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
I was quite pleased.,0.4927,0.516,0.484,0.0,p31
Working with him was sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix the technical problem as fast as possible given that we had two peoples' worth of manhours but only n actual hours.,-0.1027,0.039,0.912,0.05,p31
Um  and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was interesting.,0.1779,0.291,0.53,0.179,p31
Okay  great.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p31
Uh  I  when I get stressed tend to get a little snippy with people I'm working with.,-0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,p31
I think it is not uncommon.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
Um  but definitely when I'm - especially when I'm tired it's like 4 AM in the morning and I'm working with people.,0.3725,0.226,0.632,0.141,p31
When they're trying to explain something to me or I'm trying to explain something to them there's like inherent overhead and that can be very frustrating.,-0.1761,0.084,0.808,0.108,p31
It causes me to like  be short with people when like they're trying to explain things to me or I'm explaining things to them.,0.6124,0.185,0.815,0.0,p31
And it's something I'm working on because it doesn't actually make communication more effective  it just makes everyone unhappy.,0.1513,0.146,0.733,0.121,p31
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
One of - so - there's a couple things one is that like I have to stay up late working on things so I inevitably get practice working at not being snippy.,0.3612,0.075,0.925,0.0,p31
Um  but also like having recognized that this is something that I do  something that is not effective for communication  uh  I have been trying to pay attention to  um  you know  my tone of voice  my friendliness and I've been trying to take the approach that when I do have to try to communicate in these situations  to like  optimize by minimizing the communication needed and being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication.,0.9448,0.208,0.739,0.054,p31
Because even if I need to be like  working hard and stressing out about the work  the communication portion doesn't need to take up much time.,-0.1027,0.085,0.782,0.133,p31
And so if it takes like twice as long  it doesn't matter  because that's not the time you need to optimize.,0.6834,0.23,0.727,0.043,p31
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Last question - why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
I think you should hire me because I'm technically qualified  I get along well with people  I am interested in these fields.,0.5859,0.194,0.806,0.0,p31
Like  I'm excited about Computer Science it's like what I want to do.,0.7717,0.492,0.508,0.0,p31
It's a large part of who I am - the Math and Computer Science part of me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
And as a result  I'm going to enjoy work  and enjoy working with people.,0.7506,0.348,0.652,0.0,p31
Um  also the people I spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people I'll be interacting with at work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
And so  it tends to work out pretty well.,0.6486,0.431,0.569,0.0,p31
In my previous internship with Amazon my team liked me a lot because I'm pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people.,0.8957,0.416,0.584,0.0,p31
Bake food  you know.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p31
So I  yeah  you know I will solve your technical problems and I will get along with the team.,0.1477,0.186,0.696,0.118,p31
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p31
Ready.,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p32
Ready.,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p32
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
Good  how are you?,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,p32
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p32
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
So I’m a junior in chemical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
Im very interested in energy application so um from alternative energy to more traditional sources so basically oil fossil fuels.,0.7548,0.305,0.695,0.0,p32
Um and kind of optimizing that industry I think theres a lot of potential there so that’s that’s where my main interest is.,0.6915,0.214,0.786,0.0,p32
great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p32
and can you tell me a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p32
Um so im uh vice president of corporalations (sp) for the society of woman engineers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
And um we just held in September a career fair banquet.,0.3182,0.187,0.813,0.0,p32
So we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair.,0.3182,0.161,0.839,0.0,p32
Um and its it’s a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner.,0.6486,0.175,0.825,0.0,p32
mmhmm so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair.,0.6705,0.208,0.792,0.0,p32
uh huh and and to just give people a chance to talk.,0.25,0.154,0.846,0.0,p32
Um and so so I was working with a committee of six people and which I was the leader of and um I think one thing that I I really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on.,0.3182,0.05,0.95,0.0,p32
Um so one of the one of things that happened in the previous years when I was one of the team and not leading the uh huh team was it became very disorganized because we didn’t know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing.,-0.3597,0.0,0.95,0.05,p32
Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and I wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well.,0.2732,0.058,0.942,0.0,p32
right so in the end it ended up running very well  um  and um kind of we all got to have dinner to so that was awesome.,0.7755,0.213,0.787,0.0,p32
great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p32
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p32
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p32
um  so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering uh huh um asks us to design uh chemical plant in one of the uh software programs we use.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
um  and so it’s a very big project uh huh but its very modular.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
So you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the (sp) separator.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
Um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project.,0.3818,0.126,0.874,0.0,p32
right and so one challenge that I faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of  slacking off mmhmm um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him  had a conversation with him about it  you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project  the deadline is coming.,0.1226,0.063,0.891,0.046,p32
Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are?,0.1154,0.043,0.957,0.0,p32
And it turned out that um he wasn’t very um he wasn’t very comfortable writing the code in the program.,0.5563,0.159,0.841,0.0,p32
Mmm So he didn’t want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute Great.,0.9067,0.153,0.847,0.0,p32
Tell me about one of your weakness and what you are doing to overcome it?,-0.4215,0.0,0.833,0.167,p32
I think  um kind of within my personality Uh huh I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and  a lot of times I don’t um  realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option.,0.8885,0.168,0.832,0.0,p32
Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people  Mmhmm  In that company and figuring ouit what I wanted to do and um I think in that circumstance it would have been better after I had accepted an offer I I got other offers that I of course couldn’t consider because I was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out Uh huh  And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best Uh huh  Option in this circumstance.,0.9361,0.108,0.878,0.014,p32
So kind of this year now I definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision.,0.4019,0.137,0.863,0.0,p32
Um and it has worked out really well actually .,0.3384,0.21,0.79,0.0,p32
I I was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers I received Uh huh But over this last weekend I actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
Both companies that I was deciding between was at the conference Uh huh  And talking to the representatives really helped me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
So im glad that I waited to you know hit the buttons -great.,0.8115,0.401,0.599,0.0,p32
And last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p32
-I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are Uh huh In your job description   but also kind of the enthusiasms.,0.7466,0.169,0.831,0.0,p32
T he willingness to contribute my ideas to the Uh huh Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think great,0.7351,0.181,0.819,0.0,p32
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
I'm  uh  pretty good.,0.7269,0.753,0.247,0.0,p33
The weather's nice  uh  outside.,0.4215,0.412,0.588,0.0,p33
Oh yeah  the weather's great.,0.743,0.677,0.323,0.0,p33
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Talk about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Okay  so I'm a Junior.,0.2263,0.322,0.678,0.0,p33
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
I'm a Junior at IT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Going to graduate  uh  a semester early  actually.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Oh wow.,0.5859,0.792,0.208,0.0,p33
So I'm going to be graduating next fall.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Oh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Because uh...I  I've been doing my  my work pretty quickly I guess so I Mmhmm.,0.4939,0.186,0.814,0.0,p33
So uh I can graduate early  that's a good thing.,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,p33
Um I'm interested in going into nutrition in the long run.,0.4019,0.213,0.787,0.0,p33
Uh  whether it be through medical school or  you know  even  a certification.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Whatever  but I uh in the meantime  I want to get into Life Sciences consulting.,0.1154,0.094,0.906,0.0,p33
And I want to um explore the field and and and uh yeah...do it as as soon as I can  pretty  much  as long as I can.,0.5423,0.153,0.847,0.0,p33
In the field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Um being successful.,0.5859,0.655,0.345,0.0,p33
Uh  and getting somewhere.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Uh  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p33
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
So tell me about how you have demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Okay  so I am President of the Endometrius Society  and last year we organized a networking event so uh that  that comprised of not only students but also  like  working professionals in the Boston area  so basically I got in touch with and invited every single Armenian that I knew  in the Boston area  and it ended up being a hundred plus event that we actually coordinated in one of the dorms here in Bexley hall  so it was also a lot of logistical um  you know  like  practice  getting over uh  getting around the rules and stuff with capacity and everything and whether or not to serve alcohol and all that stuff.,0.7876,0.067,0.933,0.0,p33
So uh that that was a very big event and uh it was very successfully because people were still talking about it today.,0.5413,0.137,0.863,0.0,p33
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Good job.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,p33
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p33
So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p33
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p33
Okay  so  I'm also involved in MIT Undergraduate research journal  and uh last spring we we we we publish twice a year  at the end of each semester  and last spring um we were a little late in our uh  in our uh  timeline  so  it was kind of near finals week  and we still hadn't gotten anything published.,0.2263,0.032,0.968,0.0,p33
So  uh  sorry this was last fall  so we still had the spring semester to uh sort of remediate our uh error.,-0.507,0.0,0.824,0.176,p33
So um  we kind of  um  all  you know  pitched in together  and I guess the main thing we had to uh draw upon was each other's initiative  like in the whole process  and motivation  and motivation  you know  for some people  it's more self-centered  and for others  it's more of a community motivation  you know?,0.8271,0.157,0.843,0.0,p33
And we each had to tap into our individual editors' motivation you know  what kind of people they were  what they were looking for  et cetera  so we had to get people kind of  uh  self started in a way.,0.34,0.058,0.942,0.0,p33
And uh  yeah  we we got to work really quickly and uh and and we had it published by like the first two weeks of the spring semester so uh.,0.5719,0.144,0.856,0.0,p33
yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
It was a good skill that I picked up  kind of  how to tap into people's sense of initiative and stuff.,0.4404,0.127,0.873,0.0,p33
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Definitely.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
Uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to work on it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p33
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
So  uh  one of my weakness I think is  uh  like well  shyness.,-0.128,0.246,0.481,0.273,p33
You know  um um and I may see a little like confident  you know  on the outside  but um I definitely have my moments where I'm like you know  I just  freeze  and I feel like so  you know  like I can't talk to anyone  pretty much  you know  and it's like  it's like maybe ten percent of the time that I'm like that  but uh I kinda want to like get rid of that completely  so  yeah I'm just I'm doing  I'm like putting myself into more like  challenging situations  socially and stuff  to kind of like overcome it.,0.9939,0.392,0.608,0.0,p33
So um  yeah  just  like  you know  taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way  to be social  and stuff  like going to parties  and just being used to being around people  because definitely at MIT you can become  like  socially uh  you know  like  blocked away  so.,0.9557,0.356,0.611,0.033,p33
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p33
And last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p33
Um  so I draw upon a lot of leadership experiences  with my enrollment at MIT student groups  um  I've completed three years of MIT without going insane  that's just a joke  but um  um...and I'm very  you know  like  um I'm very organized  I'm a self-starter  I'm  you know  I take initiative  I've organized a lot of events through these student groups  so I'm I'm um  I'm definitely able to take upon like large tasks with being organized  and you know very  like  having initiative.,0.9465,0.18,0.82,0.0,p33
So yeah.,0.3597,0.714,0.286,0.0,p33
so how are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I'm doing pretty well.,0.6486,0.726,0.274,0.0,p34
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p34
Tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I'm a Junior in course two  [?unknown word?].,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I just started going to last semester but I got very interested in product design when I took a class called product design.,0.611,0.154,0.846,0.0,p34
It was really cool because we got to work in small teams to make our own projects.,0.3804,0.139,0.861,0.0,p34
So ours was a toy called Con[?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
Control  and my main role is to do a lot of the solid worksing[?],0.1531,0.11,0.89,0.0,p34
so I make a lot of the CAD 3-D modeling so that we could make the physical components that didn't already exsist.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I really enjoyed that because it's kind of an intersection between designing a part and engineering  which I have never really thought of until last year.,0.5563,0.126,0.874,0.0,p34
Outside of classes I try to do a lot of design work as well  maybe in somewhat different fields.,0.2732,0.104,0.896,0.0,p34
Like I work for the Tech as a production editor.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p34
So It's a lot of making info graphics and laying out the entire newspaper and making it look really pretty.,0.5413,0.155,0.845,0.0,p34
It's kind of a good break though from equations and things like that.,0.6597,0.329,0.671,0.0,p34
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,p34
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I think a very recent example is I am going to be chair of my sorority so we just held an event called catwalk  which is ten months of planning  but it took a lot of delegation  a lot of staying on top of things because there's so many components they needed to coordinate.,0.296,0.04,0.96,0.0,p34
We ended up having fourteen designers but we had to contact way more than that from around the Boston area.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
And the sorority has a hundred forty girls in it  so all of them has to participate in some way  whether it's working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or logistics.,0.5106,0.112,0.888,0.0,p34
I personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I had a co-chair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on Google Docs to stay on top of things  Great.,0.9145,0.364,0.636,0.0,p34
And can you tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p34
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p34
If I may  I'll go back to toy product design  'cause I think that was a really good good example.,0.7485,0.261,0.739,0.0,p34
I think all of us--it was a team of three freshmen and two sophomores--none of us had that much experience with product design at all  so we were all bringing different skills to the table and different ideas  different preferences and visions for what we wanted to do  and they clashed a lot in the beginning.,0.2263,0.033,0.967,0.0,p34
It was really difficult for us  like our personalities clashed as well  not just our ideas  which was really difficult to work with because meetings were unproductive  and we just felt like we weren't moving anywhere because other teams were moving forward with their ideas  prototyping things  and we were still arguing over what design would be most feasible  or what was interesting.,0.0552,0.132,0.753,0.115,p34
So we worked through that by just--we worked with our mentors  talking to them as kind of a mediator so it wasn't a completely self-motivated resolution or self--I don't know how to describe it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
But it ended up working out  we all kind of slowed down  took a step back  and saw from eachother's perspectives  talked out very explicitly what the plus and minuses of each idea were and what our goals were  given the constraints of the class  being that we had a two hundred dollar budget and just a semester to complete it in.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
And at this point  like a month left to go.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p34
And in the end we just recognized eachother's strengths and we could each take on responsibility for a certain component of the toy  and figure out a way to just meld them all together into the final product.,0.5859,0.118,0.882,0.0,p34
And we did by the end.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
We had something that we were really proud of.,0.5256,0.298,0.702,0.0,p34
Like a lot of teams ended up relying a lot on their mentors to kind of do the project for them  but because we each wanted to take so much ownership of the project it was very much our own  and we were able to present it on the final day  and that's something that was very rewarding Great.,0.9307,0.187,0.813,0.0,p34
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p34
I think one of my weaknesses is my--I forget what it is called.,-0.5267,0.0,0.714,0.286,p34
Oh  lack of assertiveness  or lack of confidence in a way.,-0.0772,0.208,0.503,0.289,p34
Like I always want to make sure that everyone's ideas are heard  and I feel like lots of times I don't want to create conflict  so I'll kind of back down after a little bit.,0.5047,0.205,0.668,0.127,p34
I'm very open to sharing my ideas  but if there's a lot of criticism then I will back down  and that's something that I'm working on a lot  like just trying to stand behind my own ideas  trying to be more objective about them so I have reasons to resent so that I don't feel like there's any reason for me to need to back down.,-0.5078,0.071,0.815,0.114,p34
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p34
I think you should hire me because I am very passionate about product design.,0.5709,0.221,0.779,0.0,p34
I feel like it's something that people told me when I started the mechanical engineering lessons  they were like Oh  you just lit up and I can see that you found your passion here.,0.7906,0.205,0.795,0.0,p34
I feel like I'm very detail oriented  so I'm able to create CAD models in a very methodical manner  instead of just drawing random things together.,0.6697,0.22,0.78,0.0,p34
I'm able to think of design for manufacturing overall  and not just what looks nice on paper  but what's actually practicable.,0.2263,0.087,0.913,0.0,p34
I think I am a great team player in that even though I can be passive sometimes  in a way it's good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness  and different levels of confidence  because that way it's not all like  butting heads all the time.,0.8014,0.209,0.707,0.085,p34
And I think that as I improve in my own smoothly and not confrontationally with people  but also get things done very effectively.,0.7383,0.229,0.771,0.0,p34
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p34
Yeah  so how are you doing today?,0.296,0.268,0.732,0.0,p35
I'm good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,p35
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p35
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Ok  well i'm a junior at MIT and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Biology.,0.5106,0.249,0.751,0.0,p35
It's a new joint major with a minor in management.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
So that's a little bit of my background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Um  last summer I worked at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.,0.25,0.154,0.846,0.0,p35
I was in their principal investing group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
So  I was investing in a lot of longer term securities.,0.296,0.18,0.82,0.0,p35
So  it was like buy side trading.,0.4144,0.315,0.685,0.0,p35
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p35
So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Ok  so  my freshman year  um  I was doing this project called Six Four Seventy and this is during IEP.,0.296,0.104,0.896,0.0,p35
It's like a competition where you're supposed to get a team and design your on website.,0.3612,0.143,0.857,0.0,p35
So  it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before.,0.4144,0.133,0.867,0.0,p35
Well  I had a little background but not much.,0.1406,0.162,0.838,0.0,p35
Um  and  basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
And it's IEP  everyone is trying to have fun also.,0.5106,0.268,0.732,0.0,p35
Then I was like guys we have deadlines.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p35
We need to get a B in this.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
So  basically I stepped into a leadership roll and I brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p35
It didn't win any of us awards but at least we finished it.,-0.0093,0.133,0.732,0.135,p35
Ok  so  tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.3612,0.179,0.821,0.0,p35
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p35
I guess that is kind of related to my previous example.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
I can talk more in depth about it  I guess.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p35
Um  so  I guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Um  which none of us had ever programmed with  like  MySQL or any of those languages before  you know.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,p35
So  um  I basically tried to delegate tasks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
So  I made one of my friends set up the  uh  get hub server and then another friend.,0.743,0.283,0.717,0.0,p35
I said ok  just try to focus on like the matching algorithms.,0.5719,0.32,0.68,0.0,p35
Then I'll try to put all these things together and create  like  the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah.,0.7003,0.228,0.772,0.0,p35
So that was my team experience.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Ok  so that's [pause] Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?,-0.0772,0.097,0.793,0.11,p35
I think one of my weaknesses is  um  when I am working on a team sometimes I try to do too much myself.,-0.3612,0.0,0.898,0.102,p35
Um  like  sometimes  like  people are  say: oh what can I help you with?,0.7717,0.412,0.588,0.0,p35
but if they had previously shown inconsistency in the past  then I'll try to get it done on my own and not really  like delegate things to them  so yeah.,0.2045,0.109,0.805,0.086,p35
That's something I need to work on I think.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
And  what are you doing to overcome it?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Uh  to overcome it  I am trying to be a better leader.,0.4404,0.209,0.791,0.0,p35
Um  I am actually going through this leadership  uh  program right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
It's called CCLP  so that's been helping me a lot with my leadership skills.,0.3535,0.159,0.841,0.0,p35
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p35
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
I think you should hire me because I have the necessary background experience.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
Um  from my past summers at  uh  Wells Fargo and also because I can get work done.,0.25,0.111,0.889,0.0,p35
I will work well on a team  but at the end of the day if things aren't getting done  I will over-compensate and do it myself.,0.1406,0.058,0.942,0.0,p35
So  you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p35
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
Huh  pretty well  how are you?,0.6486,0.57,0.43,0.0,p37
Me too.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
Um i am a junior in course 18 which is applied math.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
Uh  Obviously I go to MIT  uhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
whoops sorry.,-0.0772,0.0,0.435,0.565,p37
I'm also probably going to major in management science uhm  as well as I'm really interested in minoring in economics.,0.624,0.221,0.779,0.0,p37
Um outsie of academics I do a lot of sports  I play water polo  I rock clmb a lot  uhm I run and bike a lot and uh I'm involved in lots of random clubs at MIT so I like to keep busy.,0.6344,0.112,0.888,0.0,p37
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership Uhm well I've been swimming  well I was a varsity swimmer in hs as well as college   uhm  so I swam competitively for 15 years.,0.6486,0.174,0.826,0.0,p37
Uhm  so I was the captain of my high school as well as my summer club swim team.,0.2732,0.11,0.89,0.0,p37
Uhm  leadership wise I guess the summer swim team was where I felt like I had  had the most influential leadership position.,0.8313,0.316,0.684,0.0,p37
Uhm   just because I was on the same team for 14 years.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
Uhm and so I really got to develop my relationships with all of the younger swimmers  uhm  even before I was in an official captain position Great  can you give me an idea of like  how you... Oh  um  so I did a lot of uh  uh  coaching of younger kids  uhm  a lot of team management as in like setting up events  setting up meets  heping meets and everything running smoothly  uhm  as well as just leading   you know  cheers  helping people stay focus and stay organized at practices.,0.9382,0.164,0.836,0.0,p37
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p37
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p37
How did you solve that problem.,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p37
Hm well I was on the financial metrics team  in my internship last summer which was basically just the quantitative analysis team.,0.2732,0.091,0.909,0.0,p37
Uhm  and so we had a problem in one of our like  quantitative analysis programs that was running and non one really knew where it was coming from.,-0.0516,0.08,0.833,0.087,p37
So as a team we uh  like divide and conquer  broke down uh individual sections of the program to look at and uh  correlated those with each persons expertise  so I analyzed mainly the R portion whereas um  my teammate  my coworker and lets me lead my sequel portion of the code and broke it up that way  I guess.,-0.4767,0.038,0.876,0.086,p37
Great  and you guys found the problem?,0.34,0.347,0.424,0.229,p37
Yeah  eventually Great With help from the uh  finance expert Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,0.7579,0.277,0.646,0.077,p37
Uhm  Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
I would say one of my weaknesses is that I don't always push myself hard enough  uhm as far as academically.,-0.4404,0.0,0.83,0.17,p37
I like to be challenged but I don't always seek those out.,0.1406,0.135,0.772,0.093,p37
Um  so to overcome that I have done a lot of searching through the MIT coursework to  uhm  find classes that look interesting as well as challenging and to sign up for a lot of classes that are outside just the minimum major requirements so that I could get a bit more of a challenge instead of just doing the bare minimum.,0.7152,0.121,0.879,0.0,p37
And why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
Uhm  because I'm a very fast learner.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p37
Um  I'm dedicated and I know how to work hard  because it's something that I've done for my entire life and  uh  I like being busy and I like working hard.,0.7351,0.217,0.707,0.076,p37
So if I'm given a task I'll work hard until its done well Great.,0.7003,0.333,0.591,0.075,p37
So  how are you doin'?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Pretty good.,0.7269,1.0,0.0,0.0,p4
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
So  please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p4
Uhh  so I'm a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm  so right now I'm currently in the middle of my junior year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
I'm looking for a summer internship company and uhh- Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm  so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a G- uhh sorry a jet engine for GE.,-0.0772,0.0,0.958,0.042,p4
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm I had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine.,0.7506,0.261,0.739,0.0,p4
Uhh- that we would have to present at uhh something to present to GE engineers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasn't really able to do much.,-0.5563,0.0,0.902,0.098,p4
And uhh another person ended up uhh sh- wasn't showing up very much so during that time I sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who weren't sick uhh and basically help them communicate  talk to each other  and set up meetings.,0.6599,0.114,0.886,0.0,p4
Uhh  I sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a different challenge.,0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,p4
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p4
Umm uhh umm so over the summer I was working at at Auburn University.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Um I was doing uhh UAV collision avoidance algorithms.,-0.6369,0.0,0.574,0.426,p4
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
So like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of UAVs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other.,0.6801,0.191,0.809,0.0,p4
Umm I was working with a partner  but in a larger context of umm a dozen students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming AI sort of aeronautics umm sort of project  uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of UAV design.,0.3626,0.058,0.942,0.0,p4
Umm so that became a bit of an issue  umm but umm I think basically what ended up happening was I worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed.,0.5023,0.077,0.923,0.0,p4
Basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up  up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for UAV.,0.6369,0.152,0.848,0.0,p4
And umm in that case I drew upon a lot of resources that were available there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us  the professor who was in charge of the ex- uhh the project as well as with other students in the program.,0.6705,0.178,0.822,0.0,p4
Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,p4
Ummm  so I think one of my weaknesses is that umm I have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late.,0.2263,0.107,0.815,0.078,p4
Umm this is actually probably after I'm used to after I'm used to going to a certain place umm because I have a tendency to think that  and especially in the mornings because I have a tendency to think oh I can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed.,0.6486,0.108,0.892,0.0,p4
So  I think uhh what I tend to do uhh what I'm trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where I need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time.,0.6908,0.082,0.918,0.0,p4
It's something that I've tried to implement over the past couple weeks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Now  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p4
Umm I think you should hire me  because umm basically I've demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience  a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that I think I would be an asset to your company.,0.7269,0.1,0.9,0.0,p4
Umm I think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh I have a good balance that would be useful to you.,0.7003,0.167,0.833,0.0,p4
Oh  thank-,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p4
So  Jay  please tell me about yourself.,0.3774,0.301,0.699,0.0,p42
Um  so I'm a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
I'm in aerospace engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Um  I'm thinking of doing more of the  the aeronautics side rather than the astronautics side  although I don't have to decide until later.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Um  I'm in ROTC and  you know  in the Air Force portion.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
I'm hoping to become a pilot.,0.4215,0.359,0.641,0.0,p42
Uh  I applied pretty recently and I'll find out maybe in February or March of next year.,0.4939,0.167,0.833,0.0,p42
Um  I'm also in Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Our house is on the East campus across the river and I've been living there since I was a sophomore.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Um  that's  that's basically me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p42
So uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Um  so  probably the biggest chance I got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when I went to pretty much ROTC's version of boot camp.,0.6369,0.148,0.852,0.0,p42
It's called field training and it's about a month long and it's in Alabama.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
And it's pretty much a test to see what you'd do in really stressful situations.,-0.101,0.162,0.657,0.182,p42
So  uh  they'd give us pretty big things like we'd have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and we'd have to make sure they got to this place at the right time and then do um  I guess the correct action when we get there.,0.7906,0.151,0.849,0.0,p42
And make sure nobody's going astray or making sure that like all the obstacles the instructors set up  uh  we can overcome them.,0.5423,0.247,0.662,0.091,p42
So  being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably um  the most challenging leadership experience I've ever had.,0.1815,0.134,0.781,0.086,p42
Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
That's all very interesting.,0.4576,0.499,0.501,0.0,p42
So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.058,0.942,0.0,p42
How did you solve the problem.,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p42
Um  hm  to give I guess a non-ROTC-related example  um  as we have a decent amount of projects in um  Core 16 like Unified is  a lot  is very project based in the second semester and  um  one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that um  I guess  the work was being allocated.,0.34,0.079,0.88,0.042,p42
So at first  it was supposed to be um  very evenly divided so each person on the four-person team would do a quarter of the work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
But  um  some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
And by the middle of the semester  it was very unequal.,-0.4005,0.0,0.788,0.212,p42
And so  it was kind of getting  you know  under everyone's skin.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So  as a group  after we um  we realized that it just wouldn't  it was really a detriment to our productivity  we all had a group meeting and said  listen  this is what we have to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
We have to reallocate the certain things that are um  are the parts of the project that um  we had  we wanted to originally and um  it just kind of went astray.,0.2732,0.063,0.937,0.0,p42
So  we did that  and we became a lot better.,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,p42
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p42
So  um  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.056,0.944,0.0,p42
How did you solve the problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p42
Um  working on a team  faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.14,0.86,0.0,p42
Um  hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
I can think of um  try to not um  hit the same categories.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So um  in SAE  in the fraternity that I'm in  last semester I was the recruitment chair.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So  the  the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan Rush.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Like  plan our events for CPW  plan our events for fall rush  plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year  or for a full school year  excuse me.,0.4215,0.116,0.884,0.0,p42
Um  and  the question was challenges in a group  right?,0.0772,0.126,0.874,0.0,p42
Um  this was  tell me about when you were  tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.048,0.952,0.0,p42
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p42
How you solved the problem.,-0.1531,0.269,0.385,0.346,p42
So it's challenges and teamwork.,0.1477,0.283,0.717,0.0,p42
So  challenges and teamwork.,0.1513,0.347,0.653,0.0,p42
So  rush is very team-oriented because you're trying to work with your brothers to um  really see I guess  which freshmen uh  are the most compatible with your fraternity.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
And that you'd probably have the best time with.,0.6369,0.344,0.656,0.0,p42
So  the way I set it up was we actually did work in small teams of about 4 or 5 brothers and we'd go out and you know  do fun things and meet freshmen.,0.5106,0.091,0.909,0.0,p42
I would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others.,0.0754,0.121,0.769,0.109,p42
And the team that I was in  uh  was a little bit less active and  of course as being rush chair  I didn't want that to be the case.,0.2314,0.071,0.889,0.04,p42
I wanted to change that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So  um  especially in situations where you don't have um  you don't have like hard  given  not given  but like outlined powers.,-0.4717,0.047,0.78,0.173,p42
Like you're not someone's boss.,0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,p42
You're just like another brother in the fraternity.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p42
Um  the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation.,0.91,0.458,0.542,0.0,p42
So that's what I ended up using a lot to get for a while as rush chair to get people to go out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So it was all  always being like very excited to do it and like knowing that you're passionate about it and telling them  or and like having them realize that oh  this is a really good thing that we should be doing.,0.9412,0.318,0.682,0.0,p42
And it will really help us out and it will be fun.,0.7425,0.386,0.614,0.0,p42
So that's how I solved that problem.,-0.1531,0.214,0.51,0.276,p42
Uh  very good.,0.4927,0.615,0.385,0.0,p42
So  can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to improve upon it?,0.6486,0.297,0.586,0.117,p42
So  my greatest weakness.,0.3431,0.469,0.21,0.321,p42
I normally would probably have to think a lot more about.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
But  I actually had a similar conversation with um one of my bosses in ROTC about a month and a half ago.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So  I would say my greatest weakness is when I get put in really stressful situations  I will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and won't necessarily think about  or  I think through the whole process um  like to fruition.,0.079,0.124,0.758,0.118,p42
I'll kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so  um  so the situation can be like  I guess resolved.,0.6915,0.289,0.711,0.0,p42
So what I'm working on is just being able to like even in a stressful situation and I know it is a problem to kind of slow down and take a step back and really like at things kind of from a higher altitude.,-0.1796,0.103,0.78,0.117,p42
That's very good.,0.4927,0.615,0.385,0.0,p42
And so  think about a job that you'd like later.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p42
Why do you think we should hire you for this position?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Um  I'm a really hard worker.,-0.1761,0.0,0.747,0.253,p42
I absolutely will devote myself to um  this company.,0.3976,0.251,0.749,0.0,p42
I  I think as a team member  I'm very cooperative.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
Uh  if the goal we have as a team  if I agree with it  and for the most part I will.,0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,p42
And if I won't then I'll voice  and like I'll voice my concerns and try to make it something everyone can agree on.,0.6124,0.192,0.808,0.0,p42
And if I agree on it  um  then I am or I'll definitely be able to participate in the team in a very productive manner.,0.6369,0.184,0.816,0.0,p42
I'll be a very good follower and if  um  if it's needed I can be a very good leader as well.,0.8169,0.32,0.68,0.0,p42
Thank you Jay  I appreciate you coming.,0.6369,0.51,0.49,0.0,p42
All right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p42
So  can you tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Sure  so I'm a senior at MIT in management and computer science.,0.3182,0.173,0.827,0.0,p43
Uhm  I'm really interested in the intersection of the two.,0.4576,0.25,0.75,0.0,p43
So  you know  not just  uhm  you know  how computers can  you know  you know  how  like the best algorithms to do about computers?,0.7717,0.233,0.767,0.0,p43
like you know inventing the next algorithm  the next compression algorithm  not really something that I'm interested in doing.,0.6369,0.234,0.766,0.0,p43
But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses.,0.8126,0.291,0.709,0.0,p43
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
Let me open my questions up here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
So  uhm  can you tell of a time where you demonstrate leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Sure  so  uhm  I guess I'd say earlier this year.,0.3182,0.204,0.796,0.0,p43
So I'm actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow  you know  recruit or retain the freshmen that they have.,0.2263,0.041,0.959,0.0,p43
Uhm  and  the REX Event that we had uh  we threw a bunch of events  had about ten workers that we had  were able to give early arrival to.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
So free housing.,0.5563,0.642,0.358,0.0,p43
Uh  so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend.,0.4019,0.109,0.891,0.0,p43
Wow.,0.5859,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
So can you tell me about a time where you're working on a team and face a challenge?,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p43
how did you go about resolving it?,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,p43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
So I think there's  you know  always been challenges.,0.0772,0.14,0.86,0.0,p43
So last summer when I was at Disney  uhm  there were  there was some disagreement about uh  how we should  when we should schedule  the  uh  what week we should schedule the  uh  trial for.,-0.3612,0.0,0.932,0.068,p43
Uhm  and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm  uh  dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then we'd have to have the app also consider time zone issues.,0.3919,0.09,0.875,0.036,p43
So basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that  you know  by changing this date  pushing it back  we're adding scope to the app and we're going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back.,0.2263,0.035,0.965,0.0,p43
Ahh  that makes sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Yep.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
Uhm  so  uh  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you've done to over come it.,0.34,0.191,0.682,0.127,p43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
So I think the  the problem  uhm  that I have the most is  uh  in delegating task to people.,-0.4019,0.0,0.87,0.13,p43
So  uhm  I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things.,0.4336,0.177,0.823,0.0,p43
So basically I've been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do?,0.25,0.105,0.895,0.0,p43
no.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
I think let's.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
you know  lets get someone else to do it  and that way also they also they learn it so  you know  when I graduate they're able to take on that role.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Uhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Thanks.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
So I guess thinking  uhm  about a job that you like to apply for.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,p43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
Uh  Why should we hire you for this position?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p43
I think uhm  I combine  you know  technical expertise with uh  business expertise and product expertise.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p43
So  hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is  uh  would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and I've worked in all these areas in the past  uhm  and I'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates  uhm  have.,0.3612,0.042,0.958,0.0,p43
Ah  well thank you for coming.,0.5574,0.535,0.465,0.0,p43
Thank you for having me.,0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,p43
Um  please tell me about yourself.,0.3182,0.315,0.685,0.0,p44
Okay  um  my name's Evan  Evan Muray  I'm a junior here at MIT in computer science.,0.2263,0.112,0.888,0.0,p44
I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
And  uh  yeah I currently live across the river.,0.296,0.216,0.784,0.0,p44
I heard about this study through e-mail.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
So  thought I'd check it out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
So  I lived in Louisville.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
You did?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p44
Nice.,0.4215,1.0,0.0,0.0,p44
Anyway.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
So can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
A leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
Uh sure.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p44
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work  activities  so I'm involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills.,0.4404,0.094,0.906,0.0,p44
One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children who's parents have or have had cancer.,-0.6597,0.0,0.882,0.118,p44
Um  and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
Um  in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who'd would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year  send them newsletters  send them updates  plan reunions for them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students  so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator  we usually work in tandem.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
The other activity is dance troop.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
It's another student organization here at MIT  where we put on a show each year and dance  have some fun  it's a dance show  and I'm a choreography for that organization as well.,0.6597,0.148,0.852,0.0,p44
I lead a dance  teach people some dance moves for some fun.,0.5106,0.231,0.769,0.0,p44
Oh  that's all very excellent.,0.6115,0.5,0.5,0.0,p44
Thanks.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p44
So  can you tell me a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?,-0.1531,0.112,0.791,0.097,p44
Sure  uh  I think a great example of that would be this past January  I participated in a web design competition here on campus  6470  I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours.,0.8625,0.211,0.789,0.0,p44
It's always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them.,0.4767,0.154,0.846,0.0,p44
There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go.,-0.3182,0.0,0.85,0.15,p44
We had different visions for how we wanted it to look  and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think it's a very important skill and also just listening  active listening.,0.8718,0.21,0.79,0.0,p44
I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website.,0.2732,0.139,0.861,0.0,p44
And by doing that  um  I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards  I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but  I mean  we needed to get through it.,0.4411,0.085,0.89,0.025,p44
So tell me one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,0.4019,0.213,0.66,0.127,p44
My greatest weakness... Hm.,0.34,0.467,0.222,0.311,p44
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p44
Uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
I'd say my  one of my bigger weaknesses is  uh  I'd say  probably uh  self-starting  actually.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p44
It's something I've been working  it's like my goal for this year  to work on.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,p44
In the past I would do my classes  take my classes  and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
If there's one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT  is if you have an idea just go for it.,0.5859,0.132,0.868,0.0,p44
It's very easy  especially here  there's resources to do so  and  it's something that I want to work on  I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own.,0.5849,0.166,0.834,0.0,p44
It's always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects.,0.2732,0.084,0.916,0.0,p44
But  this  I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that  and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences.,0.8462,0.253,0.747,0.0,p44
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p44
So uh think of a job you'd like to get hired for  why do you think we should hire you?,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,p44
Uh  I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly  coming to MIT for example  I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science.,0.7579,0.178,0.822,0.0,p44
Many of my past internships  I've been going to  I don't have much experience  but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems.,0.4215,0.157,0.768,0.076,p44
I find that  uh  after doing some examples of a certain problem  or just playing around with it for a little bit  I can get to work on using that sort of technology.,0.0516,0.107,0.82,0.074,p44
In the past couple internships  I've had to deal with new languages  new framework  and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience I'm lacking.,0.4019,0.094,0.906,0.0,p44
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p44
Thanks again for coming again.,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p44
No problem  thank you for having me.,0.0382,0.241,0.534,0.225,p44
Of course!,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p44
So how are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
Pretty good  how are you?,0.7269,0.67,0.33,0.0,p45
Doing well.,0.2732,0.677,0.323,0.0,p45
So can you please tell me about yourself.,0.3744,0.268,0.732,0.0,p45
So uh my name's Bonnie.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
I'm a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
I'm in core six which if you don't know is in computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
I'm minoring in economics umm also mathematics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
So I'm interested in you know application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of like interesting fields so  that includes like economics  finance  biology.,0.854,0.32,0.68,0.0,p45
So a vary wide array of interests.,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.0,p45
And I'm here today because well I was uh  told it would be a good time here with the behavior study.,0.6124,0.208,0.792,0.0,p45
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p45
I went to MIT myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
Oh what year were you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
0-6.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p45
Anyway  I'd like to ask you about your leadership experiences.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p45
Can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
Okay  so I'd say one fairly informal instance actually was over this last spring break.,0.2263,0.119,0.881,0.0,p45
A couple friends and I  four of us actually  so a fairly small group  um  we biked from Philadelphia to Boston over spring break because we thought that would be a good idea.,0.7184,0.162,0.838,0.0,p45
What it actually was  huh  there were some amazing ups  some amazing downs.,0.8225,0.409,0.591,0.0,p45
umm  Definitely a very memorable experience.,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,p45
And there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was 45 degrees except your biking on the state highways  it's raining  and like ?,0.3612,0.082,0.918,0.0,p45
??,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
so we felt like giving up a little bit  just heading back up  taking the train.,0.6326,0.269,0.731,0.0,p45
And I really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this and reminding us of the fact that we were already 60% of the way through we might as well push on all the way to the end of our journey.,0.2732,0.045,0.955,0.0,p45
Just like I guess evoking everyone's different motivation because everyone you know wants to do something awesome  but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they join a team in the first place.,0.8585,0.284,0.716,0.0,p45
And I guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to uh you know different parts of our team as to why they came on in the first place and why that's still something that resonates with them.,0.3612,0.063,0.937,0.0,p45
And using that you know I was able to get the group back together and we did bike all the way back up here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
So that was a very rewarding experience.,0.5709,0.381,0.619,0.0,p45
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p45
So you can about a time when you were working on a team and faced another challenge  how did you resolve it?,0.4404,0.163,0.837,0.0,p45
Sorry  a what challenge?,0.0,0.283,0.435,0.283,p45
Another challenge  just not that particular one.,0.0772,0.178,0.822,0.0,p45
Oh  oh  another challenge.,0.0772,0.302,0.698,0.0,p45
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p45
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p45
Um  well let's see  most of the challenges I've seen coming in any sort of team work right involve either internal challenges  something that's coming from within the team  or an external challenge.,0.5046,0.178,0.822,0.0,p45
So I guess if we were to talk about an external challenge  umm  something not involving you know lack of motivation  uhh  it would  uh  let's see.,0.1027,0.123,0.8,0.077,p45
So uh  so my  my freshman year I was involved  uh  I was involved in this organization called tech fair where we basically organized a um a tech expo at the beginning of the uh  beginning of the school year.,0.3182,0.056,0.944,0.0,p45
And I was  again I was  I was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening  a lot of twelve-hour days to get the logistics down before the event.,0.3818,0.069,0.931,0.0,p45
And I guess again there it uh it does come down to really motivating people  um and speaking to their individual you know passions to get them to you know do things which they might not want to and short cut.,0.6565,0.142,0.787,0.071,p45
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p45
Can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it?,0.34,0.21,0.65,0.14,p45
Um  my greatest weakness I've noticed can be a uh lack of  lack of focus.,-0.296,0.186,0.487,0.327,p45
Especially if I have like a large number of tasks  it's very easy to instead of you know caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time.,0.7178,0.194,0.806,0.0,p45
It's very easy for me to you know pop one but still have you know like subtasks and the other things I have to do running in my mind.,0.6538,0.165,0.835,0.0,p45
Um  so of late  I've been trying to basically get more organized.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
I've you know had this hypothesis that by using a Google calendar  Google this  Google that  all these other products to try you know serve as fairly intelligent places where I can hash away my uh  my other tasks.,0.4588,0.073,0.927,0.0,p45
It will provide me with something which is very trustworthy that I will trust enough to not what worry about those tasks.,0.8624,0.336,0.664,0.0,p45
Because what usually happens  right  I just write it down on a piece of paper.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
Um I don't trust that I'll be able to find and the risk of forgetting to do something important is  is pretty great to bear.,0.6483,0.268,0.59,0.142,p45
So that  that's been pretty useful so far.,0.7269,0.504,0.496,0.0,p45
I've noticed that I've had an urge sometimes to think about other things I have to do  but I just remind myself that wait wait you wrote that down there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
You probably knew what you were doing  so don't worry about that.,0.3988,0.196,0.804,0.0,p45
There's a supervisor which is yourself taking care of your other tasks.,0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,p45
Ah  that makes sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
So uh think about a job you would like to have  why should we hire you for this job?,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,p45
So I think that one thing um I do retain in addition to well like  like I said I've had what used to be a problem in terms of being able to focus on a task but it does come with the added benefit of being able to juggle lots of tasks at the same time.,0.7351,0.146,0.824,0.03,p45
I know lots of people who do focus on one task  it often becomes one task  one project going on for you know a couple months uh becomes the forefront of their thought  their imagination  becomes what they can handle.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p45
However  having been accustomed to juggling lots of stuff in the past  I think one great skill I can bring to the table is umm provide a very  very agile agile member to the team who can juggle lots of different projects and bring insight to all of them without  with my newfound organizational abilities  getting too uhh too caught up in the mix.,0.7269,0.09,0.91,0.0,p45
Excellent  well thank you again for coming.,0.8074,0.675,0.325,0.0,p45
Thank you very much for uhh talking to me.,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,p45
Good  How are you doing?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p47
I'm well  Thanks for coming.,0.6124,0.625,0.375,0.0,p47
So please tell me about yourself?,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p47
Uhh  So my name is Skylar Shieto  I'm a junior currently here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
I'm studying course 18 mathematics  uhmm  currently enjoying it alot  uhmm  classes I'm currently taking not so much.,0.5267,0.167,0.833,0.0,p47
Mhmm Uhmm  I don't know  Is there anything in particular you want to know?,0.0772,0.091,0.909,0.0,p47
That's good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,p47
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Thanks.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p47
So  I'm gonna ask you some questions I'd like to ask.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p47
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Uhmm  ok  so I was over at Ip I did book reports.,0.296,0.167,0.833,0.0,p47
Mhmm Uhmm  I kind of assumed like a project mangerish role  particularly because I wasn't really familiar with Python too much  which is the coding language that they used to test.,0.3612,0.077,0.923,0.0,p47
Mhmm Uhmm  so I assumed more of a director kind of doing the math for it and kind of instructing people to do the mathematical thinking for that kind of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
uh-huh  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p47
So tell me about a time that you were working in a team and were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,p47
How did you go about solving the problem?,-0.0772,0.216,0.541,0.243,p47
Uhmm  Let me see  I usually take this particular example.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
One of the tough things is you having to explain things that are sort of  something that is very familiar to you to someone who doesn't have familiarity with that and  especially in a really short time.,-0.128,0.0,0.96,0.04,p47
Uhh  can be extremely difficult.,-0.4201,0.0,0.589,0.411,p47
Uhmm  It's how to deal with that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Uhh  sort of just by giving a crash course  uhm  kind of asking other friends to also help  so it's uhmm  kind of give some information and ask for feedback  that sort of thing.,0.6705,0.2,0.733,0.066,p47
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p47
uhm  so uhh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.865,0.135,p47
ok  uhh  let's see  one of my weaknesses uhhm  technical writing  uhmm  and what I'm doing to overcome that.,-0.0772,0.101,0.783,0.115,p47
Actually not very much  I'm taking a math writing class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Ah  interesting.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,p47
Uh  so that's been really helpful.,0.4754,0.382,0.618,0.0,p47
It's in a subject that I really enjoy   and I actually have a paper due this Friday so hopefully I show so improvement and that would help.,0.9267,0.371,0.629,0.0,p47
Mhmm  so now thinking of a job that you'd like to have  you got one in mind?,0.3612,0.135,0.865,0.0,p47
Uhmm  not particularly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Sorry.,-0.0772,0.0,0.0,1.0,p47
No?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Well just think of something.,0.2732,0.344,0.656,0.0,p47
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
Uhmm  soo  I would like a job which is sort of very open  uhmm  sort of open in a sense that it's open to new ideas  open to uhmm  the ability to uh  work on different stuff.,0.5859,0.121,0.879,0.0,p47
Sort of like whatever you want.,0.4215,0.487,0.513,0.0,p47
Uhm  Also  in like a sense that you can go in and wear whatever you want you don't have to wear a suit and tie everyday  uhm  yeah.,0.6124,0.194,0.806,0.0,p47
(Sirens in background) So are you thinking of being a mathematician.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p47
(laughs) uh  wouldn't be too bad.,0.7227,0.602,0.398,0.0,p47
(laughs) Fair enough  well cool.,0.836,0.908,0.092,0.0,p47
I think this is also the sort of place where I can do things that are in my interest  uhmm  like statistics or computer science.Those sort of things.,0.6705,0.175,0.825,0.0,p47
Ah  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p47
Well thanks for coming in today.,0.6124,0.556,0.444,0.0,p47
How are you I'm doing well Excellent.,0.7003,0.537,0.463,0.0,p48
So  uh  please tell me about yourself.,0.3774,0.301,0.699,0.0,p48
Uh  I'm a student  I study computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p48
Uh  I'm in my last year so when I graduate in May I'm going to be working on computer science stuff Mhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p48
Now I'm going to ask you a series of questions  um  starting out with tell me a time where you demonstrate leadership I demonstrate leadership on the track team  I was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh  seniors on the team myself included uh   lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able to...to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that.,0.8442,0.097,0.903,0.0,p48
Tell me a time where you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p48
How did you end up solving the problem Hm... in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn’t have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group.,-0.3818,0.031,0.87,0.098,p48
So the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p48
So that was pretty rough  but this happened like a year ago.,0.6686,0.354,0.646,0.0,p48
So like one of my close friends was like I cant afford these prices  like there's just no way.,0.8268,0.402,0.517,0.081,p48
And like then it dominoes  which was a huge problem.,0.2732,0.331,0.483,0.186,p48
Hm And a lot of people suggested a lot of different...a lot of different solutions.,0.1779,0.108,0.892,0.0,p48
Most of them were like motivated from anger.,0.2023,0.387,0.352,0.261,p48
Hm So uh  some people were like everybody who moves out should have to pay and other people were like oh no if I'm if not living there I shouldn’t have to do anything so  so it was like pretty contentious.,0.7322,0.216,0.67,0.114,p48
mm But  but we worked it out to a... it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested which was that we would uh  we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room.,0.5023,0.07,0.93,0.0,p48
So we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more  but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh  could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money.,0.023,0.122,0.759,0.12,p48
So  so we kept some of the people we kicked out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p48
Oh good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,p48
Yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed.,0.7096,0.396,0.604,0.0,p48
Mhm  so uh  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to improve upon it.,0.1027,0.124,0.769,0.107,p48
Uh  I'm the opposite of type A so I can be pretty disorganized.,0.25,0.195,0.671,0.134,p48
My lab notebooks like a lot of the time I make a lot of scribbles in at and when I write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side.,0.4767,0.139,0.808,0.053,p48
Um  so  so  it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing ?,-0.0276,0.0,0.931,0.069,p48
I never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that I've been on that I had to leave  uh  the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where I left off and had no idea what was going on and I was like this is actually a problem the teachers like don't just tell you to document just to aggravate you.,-0.5859,0.089,0.764,0.147,p48
So  I worked uh  so like since then like I've been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it.,0.6565,0.221,0.779,0.0,p48
So that like there’s some kind of like review before like I show other people or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it.,0.7569,0.211,0.789,0.0,p48
So just to like read my documentation that and which I've never done before until this most recent project had that problem Well that's always a good practice.,0.6204,0.225,0.696,0.078,p48
Yeah So now  thinking about a job that you’d like to have  do you have one in mind?,0.5719,0.227,0.773,0.0,p48
Sure  yeah So now  why should we hire you?,0.5423,0.391,0.609,0.0,p48
Mostly because uh  results.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p48
I'm  I just like get things done.,0.3612,0.294,0.706,0.0,p48
And there’s a like  there's a lot of things I know how to do  especially the job I'm thinking of is like a programming job like a startup.,0.7579,0.231,0.769,0.0,p48
My background  my degree is actually nuclear engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p48
SO  so like I don't have like the background the internships the stuff like that.,0.6319,0.308,0.589,0.104,p48
A lot of the coding interview questions they tend to ask I don't know  which is pretty rough  but uh I  I think that I would be  I should be hired because I would be resourceful and I'd do what it takes to get things done which is like working longer  being more resourceful  and stuff like that.,0.8225,0.135,0.865,0.0,p48
So like  I   I feel like I could get more results then somebody who has the same  or somebody who has a better background Ah  excellent.,0.8977,0.351,0.649,0.0,p48
Well thanks for coming today.,0.6124,0.625,0.375,0.0,p48
So  please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p49
So my name is Fernando Iber  I am a junior here  I come from Puerto Rico  and I am currently studying biological engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Uh  I’m considering doing pre-medicine  maybe going into either an MD  and  let’s say  apply to some schools as an MD  or go into an MD-PHD program.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Um  my main interest is basically oncology  but  like  I  over the past few years I’m doing a couple of research programs  I did an internship  and it basically  like  gave me a view that I could tackle that problem in a lot of ways.,0.6059,0.16,0.773,0.067,p49
So not just being a clinician  but being a researcher  a medical researcher.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Oh  yes.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,p49
So that’s how I got interested into the whole MD-PHD thing  and  like  I’ve gotten a hold of some programs that I viewed  and there’s a lot out there.,0.6369,0.161,0.839,0.0,p49
I couldn’t have imagined that if I stayed home.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
It’s amazing what people do here.,0.5859,0.432,0.568,0.0,p49
Most definitely.,0.4576,0.75,0.25,0.0,p49
So can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
So I’m  I’m pretty involved in  in campus groups.,0.5367,0.302,0.698,0.0,p49
Uh  I was the first founder of  of their restructuring of Beta Theta Pi  so I’m currently  you would say  chapter president.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Uh  so I’m leading the whole  the whole cavalry of recruitment right here on campus  and we’re getting a lot of results.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Um  I’m also in the Board of Puerto Rican students  I serve as social chair  and I am also pretty involved in dorm government  especially rec-CBW planning  so I just like to get around.,0.7152,0.157,0.843,0.0,p49
So any  anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore  any guise is all pretty good for me.,0.836,0.331,0.669,0.0,p49
Uh  I was also considering something for soccer  uh  in terms of being team treasurer  but unfortunately I had a bit of an accident with my leg  so I got out of soccer.,-0.7906,0.032,0.779,0.188,p49
Sorry to hear that.,-0.0772,0.0,0.698,0.302,p49
So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team  and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?,-0.1531,0.108,0.799,0.094,p49
So  I actually have a really humbling experience.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Last semester I took a class about mechanics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
A lot of people in that class were juniors and I was a sophomore.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
So everybody there was much more experienced than me  so I was the only sophomore in my group  there were two ones that were juniors  and it was the final project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
And when we sat down and started talking about things to do  I basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning  ‘cause they already took cell biology  and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics  and they were trying to do some tissue modeling.,0.3582,0.086,0.877,0.037,p49
Like  even though it was a class about mechanics  and I could understand some of the things  I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.,0.0018,0.086,0.828,0.086,p49
And they just put me there  and one of them was really helpful  and actually guided me through the initial process  but the other one was not available at all  at any time.,0.2609,0.06,0.94,0.0,p49
So I basically had to sit down  I actually met with the professor a couple of times  just to  like  talk and chat  and we took the professor out for  for a lunch  so we could just  like  talk about stuff  and I actually had to find out my own way through everything  with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me.,0.8627,0.142,0.858,0.0,p49
And it was humbling because normally when I worked on teams  we were all pretty equal  equal minded  or it was in a humanities class.,0.4939,0.118,0.882,0.0,p49
‘Cause normally technical classes here don’t have much to do with team projects in sophomore year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
Normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students  so it was a surprise for me where it came  like  I’m a sophomore  and I’m already doing final presentations for bio-mechanics.,0.5574,0.129,0.871,0.0,p49
And it just caught me pretty off guard.,0.4939,0.314,0.686,0.0,p49
And the only way…we ended up doing an extremely awesome project  but it took lots of coffee  Red Bull  and Wikipedia.,0.4012,0.119,0.881,0.0,p49
That’s my strategy for now  ‘cause it was completely new territory right there  compared to humanities or any other classes where you’re  everybody has the same mindset.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
So that was my group trauma.,-0.4215,0.0,0.641,0.359,p49
So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you’ve done to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p49
So I didn’t have any actually trouble self-recognizing trouble about  so stemming off of  from the inexperience type of situation  that was actually the first group project I had where that experience happened  and I feel like if I get into something that I don’t  basically  know  I have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself.,-0.5563,0.039,0.849,0.112,p49
So if I don’t come prepared to do something  it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing  which is kind of a handicap  because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me.,0.2263,0.038,0.962,0.0,p49
And I  I  I obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter  but it’s hard for me.,0.34,0.169,0.777,0.054,p49
So I’ve been trying  so basically  like  the solution for me was basically studying more  putting much more effort from my part  but it’s still a big  a big minus in my  in my turf.,0.3693,0.097,0.903,0.0,p49
It’s  uh  it takes me a while to dominate things that  that I don’t have an up-to-speed inclination to that.,-0.128,0.0,0.927,0.073,p49
And that has caused  like  mishaps that  well  through hard work you can overcome them  but a lot of work  compared to your regular person.,0.2732,0.125,0.83,0.045,p49
Excellent  thank you.,0.7351,0.861,0.139,0.0,p49
Um  so I guess my last question is  thinking of a job that you’d like to have- do you have one in mind?,0.3612,0.102,0.898,0.0,p49
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p49
So now  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
So I feel like  even though I’ve gone through many obstacles  I’ve always tried and found a way to excel  exert myself to bigger than I’d previously thought.,0.4877,0.173,0.749,0.078,p49
So I might sometimes feel that I don’t have that knowledge on me  but I will go out and get it  even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort  because there’s also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can  but seeing that actually succeed.,0.9052,0.181,0.819,0.0,p49
You know what I mean?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
It’s  uh  it’s like what MIT does to you  you’re humbled by an immense amount of work  you’re humbled by  by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces  homework  and exams that you are overwhelmed.,-0.0498,0.073,0.85,0.077,p49
But you sit down  you think about stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
I sit down and I think about stuff  and I get a plan there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p49
That  the good thing about the plan  it takes some time to devise a plan  because it  it’s not as efficient  it’s not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do  but  but  having  like an educated guess  you remember the SAT’s  where it’s like “you may not always know the answer  but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be.” So that’s how I approach things when I have no idea what I’m doing  but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where I can say “hey  I’m here  let’s get crackin’.” Um  that’s sort of  like  the general mindset I have for many problems  be it the life sciences  you have to do an essay  if I have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells  or if I go by  the walks of life can take you anywhere  if I end up being a consultant for a  for Johnson and Johnson  let's say  a company for random purposes  and  it's the same way you tackle every problem.,-0.8431,0.055,0.851,0.094,p49
You get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing  then you sit down and do it.,-0.1027,0.0,0.935,0.065,p49
Uh  sometimes it's frustrating  because results don't come out like this  um  but I feel like once you get the hang of it  you can start  your productivity increases by x-fold  x be a number  much higher than one  let's talk MIT here.,0.2948,0.1,0.826,0.074,p49
Yeah  I feel that's the  that's at least my way of tackling things and it's gotten me through a lot  and it's actually helped me wear down the walls of MIT and have a better experience at it  so I feel it's the same way I should attack all the problems that come to me.,-0.1779,0.082,0.824,0.094,p49
Oh  well thank you.,0.5574,0.697,0.303,0.0,p49
I appreciate your coming today.,0.4019,0.403,0.597,0.0,p49
So please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p5
Myself  um  I'm a junior majoring in computer science at MIT I'm very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses.,0.2492,0.042,0.958,0.0,p5
I want to pursue (?),0.0772,0.245,0.755,0.0,p5
everyone.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
A time when I demonstrated leadership was  um  I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
And  um  some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially.,0.0772,0.061,0.939,0.0,p5
And by  um  by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people  what was going on in people's lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time  we were able to have a successful trip.,0.8834,0.22,0.78,0.0,p5
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p5
How did you solve the problem.,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p5
Um  a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem.,-0.4443,0.107,0.659,0.234,p5
And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didn't deny anyone's idea off the bat  we just tried to be as creative as we could be.,0.8093,0.189,0.811,0.0,p5
And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem.,-0.0516,0.139,0.754,0.107,p5
Tell me about one of your weaknesses.,-0.3612,0.0,0.706,0.294,p5
What do you plan to do to overcome it?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion.,-0.0772,0.044,0.905,0.05,p5
But it's  I find it's a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible.,0.7684,0.224,0.776,0.0,p5
So fail fast  essentially.,-0.5849,0.0,0.442,0.558,p5
That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project.,0.4215,0.104,0.896,0.0,p5
Now  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
Why I think you should hire me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p5
I think you should hire me because I'm very  I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work.,0.6597,0.13,0.87,0.0,p5
I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success.,0.5719,0.188,0.812,0.0,p5
Well  thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,p5
So please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p50
myself umm I don’t know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything I am Young.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I am Junior right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I am in my third year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I am I guess I talk about what I am majoring umm I am majoring in mathematics and physics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I am also doubling in core six computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
and umm I think I am getting minor in French and French literature.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
grew up in the states in northern virginia.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
Growing up I guess I was interested in I played a lot of competitive chess.,0.7579,0.436,0.564,0.0,p50
I was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,p50
and um other forms of excellent.,0.5719,0.425,0.575,0.0,p50
so tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
umm at high school I was at my junior and senior years I was captain of umm chess team of my high school and umm we participated in something.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
people thinks of chess as an individual sport.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
but umm we participated in quite a few team events.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
through the states which means one every year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
which we have been winning every year every year.,0.5267,0.298,0.702,0.0,p50
umm and also at the nationals.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
and before I went there they were little bit out of leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
They used to get may be fifth or so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
but when I was there I was umm managed to lead us to almost the first.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
We came in second in three years in a row.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
We came first in blitz which is speed chess.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
under my leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
and to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with.,0.6808,0.337,0.663,0.0,p50
but perhaps had they not had that environment wouldn’t have done as well Tell me a time when you worked in a team and faced a challenge.,0.4767,0.141,0.859,0.0,p50
How did you solve the problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p50
challenge umm there are countless examples when umm in group projects in high school.,0.0772,0.091,0.909,0.0,p50
umm there was one time when umm freshman year in high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
We were working on a umm we had something we called ibet integrated biology electronics and umm biology english technology we had a group project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
Four persons in the group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
and a few days before the presentation we found the person who had done a decent bit of data analysis had done it incorrectly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
and he was not available.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
he was out of town at the time.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
again we didn’t fully know what had gone wrong but he had come up with some results which were clearly umm could not be explained by experimental error.,-0.2617,0.104,0.732,0.164,p50
clearly he had done something incorrectly.,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,p50
So we had rush to fix what had gone wrong and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given the time constraint.,-0.4215,0.046,0.845,0.109,p50
We had to redivision the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and compile the final presentation Interesting of course it’s not a life threatening challenge So can you tell me one of your weaknesses?,0.5067,0.143,0.804,0.053,p50
and what are you doing to overcome it?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
weaknesses umm I guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what I want to do and focusing all my faculty on that.,-0.1045,0.132,0.726,0.142,p50
Rather than keeping ones options open which I think a good thing.,0.4404,0.209,0.791,0.0,p50
but I think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks.,0.3962,0.234,0.766,0.0,p50
this is important because where I went to high school.,0.2023,0.167,0.833,0.0,p50
The culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing.,0.4959,0.146,0.786,0.067,p50
which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open.,0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,p50
but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that.,0.9209,0.305,0.695,0.0,p50
and in the end you probably go to pick something.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically I want to do and devote resources to that.,0.4939,0.252,0.647,0.101,p50
umm what I am trying to do to address that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
but what I’ve been doing is trying out wide variety of things so I can’t use the excuse.,0.1154,0.079,0.921,0.0,p50
there are bunch of things I don’t know yet.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I’ll keep my options open.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
I’ll try them out and if I don’t like them I’ll drop.,0.1027,0.171,0.685,0.144,p50
that’s a way to decide what’s left to do that I’d like.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p50
Now think about a job that you would like to have.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p50
Why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
alright so it’s still early in terms of job search but one job that I would like that I am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance.,0.5789,0.141,0.859,0.0,p50
and umm I think I’d be a strong candidate because I have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work I’ve done physics as well.,0.8399,0.25,0.75,0.0,p50
and umm I have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports.,0.1779,0.086,0.914,0.0,p50
I have always known.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading I have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc.,0.4019,0.101,0.899,0.0,p50
trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game.,0.743,0.364,0.636,0.0,p50
and that I think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p50
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Fine So  please tell me about yourself.,0.5256,0.468,0.532,0.0,p52
Uh  I’m Daniel.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
I’m a Freshman.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Hm I’m from  uh  Fort Lauderdale  Florida.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Thinking about course AN61 here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
I  uh  actually  uh  I was here for running  but I realized it wasn’t me  so  um  I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon.,-0.3919,0.0,0.904,0.096,p52
So  um  yeah  classes I am doing fine.,0.507,0.416,0.584,0.0,p52
Looking for a job now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
That’s about it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p52
So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Uh  I’d say  probably  I’d say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration.,0.6808,0.301,0.699,0.0,p52
I was  um  senior in my  in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
I’d really  like  thought it showed them that  like  even though I wasn’t put in the best situation  like  I performed indiscriminately.,0.8999,0.4,0.6,0.0,p52
And  I think  in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even  like  half the season we were always like around the same time.,0.7579,0.158,0.842,0.0,p52
And  we ended up  uh  medaling at states.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
And I’d say that  um  a good part of that is by leading by example by the older  um  upper classmen  so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership.,0.6872,0.146,0.854,0.0,p52
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p52
So  it sounds like you have worked on a lot of teams.,0.4144,0.201,0.799,0.0,p52
Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p52
How did you go about solving it?,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,p52
Well  there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing.,0.2732,0.149,0.851,0.0,p52
So um  if it wasn’t  I think  um I went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year  and she helped me sort things a lot.,0.3612,0.07,0.93,0.0,p52
She showed that I did have  um  proper technique.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
It was more of like  like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better.,0.8605,0.324,0.676,0.0,p52
I realized that  um  as long as I kept on pursuing the sport  like  that’s all that really mattered.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,p52
That’s all  like  my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere  that will help me get into MIT.,0.6369,0.206,0.794,0.0,p52
So  I feel like  um  this  this like seeing things in my own way  right  and being distraught by other people effecting me helped.,0.259,0.186,0.694,0.119,p52
Ah  that’s  uh  very good.,0.4927,0.444,0.556,0.0,p52
So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you’ve done to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p52
I think one of my weaknesses has to be  um  the fact that  I’m a little  um  delinquent with my work.,-0.3612,0.0,0.889,0.111,p52
And  uh  um  I’m lazy at times.,-0.3612,0.0,0.706,0.294,p52
I definitely procrastinate.,0.4019,0.574,0.426,0.0,p52
It was a pursuing thing through high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
And  uh  it’s still a little now because of a passing record.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
One of my combating is goal setting.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
I learned it from one of my  uh  from one of these  one of an upperclassmen that I know in  uh  at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
He  uh  told me  like  to write out  like  weekly goals and write out long term goals.,0.6124,0.25,0.75,0.0,p52
Like  long terms goals meaning  like  the end of MIT  after MIT  what you want to do after the MIT experience  and short term goals  which is  like  get stuff done now.,0.7783,0.239,0.761,0.0,p52
So  in a way that kind of put me things  put things in perspective for me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Realize that I shouldn’t be burning too much time messing around.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
By  I mean  certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because it’s  it’s a good time to have fun and relax.,0.8885,0.365,0.635,0.0,p52
But  at the same time  I shouldn’t do it in excess.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
So  I guess that’s helped me a little bit.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
That makes since.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
So  uh  uh  think about the job you’d like to have.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p52
Might be a rep or something else.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Do you have something in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Um  actually  yeah  um.,0.296,0.423,0.577,0.0,p52
I’ve never had lab experience before  so I really want a role  which is why- O good  yeah  OK.. So now  why do you think we should give you this job?,0.7146,0.199,0.801,0.0,p52
Uh  well  for starters  um  I don’t have any experience  so I feel like  um  it’s a good place for me to start.,0.7759,0.28,0.72,0.0,p52
And I’m really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p52
Um  I see how  um  I’m not taking too many classes this semester cuz I’m a course advantage.,0.25,0.105,0.895,0.0,p52
I’ll be making sure I’ll have enough time to make classes  uh  more manageable.,0.3182,0.15,0.85,0.0,p52
I should be able to commit hours on it.,0.296,0.216,0.784,0.0,p52
I’m really interested in the job I’m doing  so  hopefully that interest will inspire me  uh  inspire me to work hard.,0.9497,0.511,0.447,0.042,p52
Ah  well  thank you for your time.,0.5574,0.479,0.521,0.0,p52
I appreciate you coming in and interviewing today.,0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0,p52
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Um  well  I was born in Nigeria.,0.2732,0.259,0.741,0.0,p53
Um  and I moved to the United States at the age of eight  um and lived here  um  in Boston actually ever since.,0.4215,0.113,0.887,0.0,p53
Um  and um  for as long as I remember umm I've always wanted to go into the medical field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm I've always wanted to be a doctor  and just recently actually discovered that I wanted to be a pediatrician umm after working with kids and doing a lot of babysitting in high school and have actually umm shadowed a neonatologist and I feel like that was when it clicked that I actually really want to be a pediatrician.,0.4754,0.067,0.933,0.0,p53
Umm and I've tutored a lot  umm middle school and high school  and that's really like affirmed the fact that I do like my career.,0.6478,0.187,0.813,0.0,p53
I want it to be something where I work with kids.,0.0772,0.115,0.885,0.0,p53
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,p53
So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
A time I've demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm I guess one obvious one is the student groups that I work with.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm my primary umm student group is the black students union.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
I'm currently a coach here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm and I've been active with the group since I've been at MIT.,0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,p53
Umm currently as a coach here I plan all events for umm the group umm as well as kind of represent the group umm in front of administration as far as like what our members want  what they need  umm if they have any concerns or anything like that.,0.7506,0.157,0.843,0.0,p53
And we have several meetings with administration on a regular basis just to communicate what's going on  what we're doing  and what our membership needs and what how they can help us with that.,0.4019,0.076,0.924,0.0,p53
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p53
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p53
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p53
Team...faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.394,0.606,0.0,p53
Umm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Okay  umm I guess back to the student group.,0.2263,0.192,0.808,0.0,p53
Umm so this is the second time I've actually been on the executive board.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm the first  umm  last year the executive board ran really smoothly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
We worked well together but this year we...we're kind of having problems 'cause it's a new set of people so it's kind of hard adjusting umm to the people I'm working with.,-0.6174,0.043,0.802,0.155,p53
Umm so you know  we all have different viewpoints  different ways of approaching things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm  so we had a lot of loss of communication  which kind of hindered umm our uh progress this year umm but in the past few weeks we've been able to kind of figure out that  you know  there's been a loss of communication  and we should definitely  like  you know  we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get the things that we want accomplished done.,0.705,0.152,0.749,0.099,p53
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p53
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p53
My weaknesses...umm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
I think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no.,-0.4215,0.0,0.797,0.203,p53
I'm the kind of person that  if someone asks me to do something even if I feel like it's impossible I always say yes.,0.6369,0.191,0.809,0.0,p53
Umm and I've always...I think I realized that problem when I came at MIT and I've been working on that ever since my sophomore year umm and I'm a junior right now.,-0.4019,0.0,0.92,0.08,p53
Umm and what I've been doing to overcome it is kind of schedule myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
Umm I have my calendar.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
I live by my calendar  and I know if it doesn't fit on my calendar  if it's overlapping with something  then absolutely no  I can't do it.,-0.5578,0.0,0.845,0.155,p53
So I live by my calendar now and it's definitely helping me say no to things when people ask me to do things for them.,0.4019,0.168,0.756,0.076,p53
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p53
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
What it is [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p53
[laughs] Umm.,0.4939,0.762,0.238,0.0,p53
I think that I am a good asset.,0.6597,0.474,0.526,0.0,p53
Umm  one  because MIT experience has definitely prepared me for  I would say  the worst  umm because of the experience as an MIT student.,-0.128,0.155,0.707,0.138,p53
So  it's a unique experience  umm but I've also umm gained a lot of umm a broad range of academic skills  umm not just in  in the life sciences but also in engineering field and political science field umm that I think I can bring into the medical field umm with the help of the knowledge that I gain in medical school to kind of help the world  which is want I want to do  ultimately.,0.9482,0.201,0.799,0.0,p53
So I think umm I would be a good asset for the medical field.,0.6597,0.31,0.69,0.0,p53
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p53
So tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Umm so I'm a junior at MIT  i'm a math major  umm i have experience in both the economic side of thing's and uhh cs  simple coding   umm interested in going into probably analytic's or trading in the future.,0.4019,0.066,0.934,0.0,p55
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Umm so I'm involved in the undergraduate study of Women in Math and one of the most recent activities we've been doing involves kind of an outreach project  umm for middle school and high school girl's where we can bring them together and have them all do a collaborative math event as opposed to normal competition math  so i kind of experimented in the project to umm do that.,0.2732,0.03,0.97,0.0,p55
It was originally aimed for just  ya know  local umm Boston girl's  so we did all the publicizing for that  I mean I know  get it a lot more publicity than we expected  people in from like California and stuff  so.,0.3612,0.059,0.941,0.0,p55
Oh  wow.,0.5859,0.792,0.208,0.0,p55
Yup.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p55
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p55
Okay  umm so I guess I'm also a member of China Development Initiative  and so a lot of times  umm  when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that.,0.7096,0.144,0.856,0.0,p55
But umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
So some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers  getting them to really correspond with us.,0.0772,0.061,0.939,0.0,p55
Like sometimes they'll respond and be like oh  were interested  but then they just don't follow up  so going after them  kinda looking for that response.,0.5187,0.189,0.811,0.0,p55
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p55
okay  umm I would say I'm generally more of a passive person  when someone gives me a task I'll do it I won't really  like if i get stuck I'll kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help.,0.3263,0.133,0.78,0.087,p55
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Umm so I've been trying to umm  i guess talk to more higher ups  if i run into issues  or ask more questions i guess.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p55
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Umm we being?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
This company that does analytic's?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p55
Umm I think i would bring a lot to the team in terms of  umm  teamwork in addition to the qualifications i have academically speaking  umm  I guess i would say that I have a lot of experience working with teams  umm a lot of experience in the analytic side of thing's as well  umm as well as a pretty interdisciplinary background in general.,0.7506,0.108,0.892,0.0,p55
So i would be able to bring a lot more  umm  i guess  umm directions to the team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p55
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p56
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Um  well  my name's Ann.,0.2732,0.344,0.656,0.0,p56
I'm currently a Junior in [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
I'm originally from San Francisco.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Um  I am interested in going to medical school.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,p56
And  I didn't really come to this decision until  like  around Au-  August or September of this year.,0.3612,0.128,0.872,0.0,p56
Oh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
I was deciding  like  I mean  I always had it  like  in the back of my mind .,0.6124,0.238,0.762,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56

'cuz my dad is a doctor.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Um  but  and I knew coming into college I wanted to study Biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
I wasn't sure if I wanted to do  um  like  research or  um  medical school.,0.1376,0.143,0.744,0.112,p56
So  um  I had a year off  or I still have a year off.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And of course [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
and I really liked it.,0.4754,0.436,0.564,0.0,p56
But I felt like research is something  uh  you have to be  like  self driven .,0.7579,0.317,0.683,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.. Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56

.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And  I kept getting  like  frustrated because a lot of my experiments  they wouldn't work  and I felt really bad.,-0.6901,0.094,0.637,0.269,p56
[??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And then  uh  I also  like  volunteer at a hospital just to  like  gain experience and see what it's like.,0.872,0.405,0.595,0.0,p56
And  uh  I enjoy helping people.,0.6597,0.574,0.426,0.0,p56
So  I think  decided for sure now [??],0.3939,0.275,0.725,0.0,p56
school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p56
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Um  I guess leadership can be  like  defined in a lot of ways  I guess.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,p56
One of my main activities that I've been doing at [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
is  um  working in a student group called ESP  or the Educational Studies Program.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Oh  OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And  um  so I teach an AP biology class on the weekends to the high school students in the area.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And I guess that's kind of like being a leader because you have to  like  stay in control of the class and organize everything.,0.5729,0.176,0.824,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p56
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p56
Um  I guess  um  the experience that's  like  most  like  strongest in my mind is actually from high school.,0.8162,0.346,0.654,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
So I used to be on  uh  my high school's robotics team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And  uh  none of us really  like  knew much about engineering or  like  building robots when we first started.,0.6478,0.237,0.763,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
So it required a lot of  like  teamwork and working together.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p56
Um  I remember communication was one of our main issues because we would divide into sub-teams and then each sub-team would  like  work on a part of the robot.,0.3612,0.082,0.918,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
But then sometimes we forgot to  like  communicate clearly with each other  and then that result in major problems down the road.,0.4235,0.228,0.638,0.134,p56
So .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p56
How did you resolve that problem?,-0.0258,0.28,0.43,0.29,p56
Um  so I guess for us it was like a spe-  special situation because  um  um  we were all  like  my friends and I  were all sophomores.,0.8689,0.32,0.68,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
And then  there were no upperclassmen above us .,-0.296,0.0,0.784,0.216,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
on our robotics team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
So  our  like  very first years that we were the leaders of our team we really struggled because we didn't  we had no  like  prior experience .,-0.2558,0.088,0.76,0.152,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
in how to organize a team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
So  like  after our first year  like  our sophomore year together  we  like  like  had a  like a sit down discussion afterwards .,0.8955,0.415,0.585,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
and  like  talked about what went wrong  like  what could've been better.,0.5859,0.416,0.421,0.163,p56
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p56
So the next year we  we have  like  uh  we implemented  like  uh  daily meetings.,0.6124,0.278,0.722,0.0,p56
So  like  before we would  like  split up for the day and  like  work on our  uh  work on our robot.,0.7778,0.302,0.698,0.0,p56
We would  like  outline a plan and then  like  show it to everyone .,0.6124,0.294,0.706,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
and  like  discuss with everyone.,0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,p56
So that really helped.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
they discuss  Great.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,p56
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p56
Um  one of my weaknesses is I'm really shy.,-0.5849,0.0,0.594,0.406,p56
Like  I think when I was younger I go-  I didn't like to  like  talk to strangers .,-0.1828,0.115,0.691,0.194,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
or talk in  in front of a large group of people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
So  um  when I came to college I thought that  uh  I should try to improve that.,0.4404,0.153,0.847,0.0,p56
So  um  I think the main thing I tried to do was the teaching activity I talked about before.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Um  requires me to  you know  stand in front of a group of high school students and talk for  like  three hours at a time.,0.3612,0.094,0.906,0.0,p56
So  I think  uh  I'm becoming a lot more comfortable  like  talking in front of people I don't really know that well.,0.8287,0.315,0.685,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm  that's great.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,p56
Um  why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
Um  I think I have  like  the passion to help people.,0.802,0.506,0.494,0.0,p56
Um  I  I had a lot of  like  volunteer activities  but I really enjoy helping people  especially  like  um  children.,0.9245,0.456,0.544,0.0,p56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
So I used to  I used to tutor  like  young children at the Cambridge Community Center and teach them how to read.,0.3612,0.106,0.894,0.0,p56
Um  and I'm currently doing the  like  tutoring  I mean  not tutoring  the AP [??],0.4329,0.17,0.83,0.0,p56
teaching.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p56
You know  um  so I'm  like  motivated to help people.,0.829,0.555,0.445,0.0,p56
Um  and I think that  like  as  especially as the world becomes  like  bigger  or the population gets greater  more and more people  like  will need medical help.,0.8996,0.361,0.639,0.0,p56
So  I think being a doctor would be a good  good way to help people.,0.8176,0.415,0.585,0.0,p56
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p56
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
I'm doing very well  thanks.,0.6779,0.65,0.35,0.0,p57
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
I'm currently a junior  pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and what's really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics.,0.2023,0.104,0.833,0.062,p57
A lot of interesting questions come up where it’s a lot of actually thinking innovatively and that’s why I’ve chose to major in both of these and  actually  that’s why I’m interesting in consulting is because it’s a good application of the problem solving that I’m doing in both of those.,0.7906,0.18,0.774,0.045,p57
Tell me about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
Umm  recently  I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project  however  umm  these was  I noticed a lack of communication  a lack of set deadlines  so  umm  in that case  I kind of stepped up.,-0.5574,0.0,0.917,0.083,p57
I organized communication between all of us.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and  you know  it’s a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline.,0.1779,0.076,0.866,0.058,p57
Umm  I’ve also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p57
Uh huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
Would you like me to tell you about one of those?,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p57
Yeah  that’d be great.,0.743,0.759,0.241,0.0,p57
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
Umm  last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that  the biggest event  especially logistically  fell under my responsibilities  so I  with a $2 200 budget  organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston  so this involved  umm  finding places  making all food allergies were taken care of  really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening  and this also involved a lot of delegation because  you know  there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldn’t personally be in charge of all of those  so I had to delegate out to a committee  make sure that they knew what was happening  manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left  who hadn’t gone as yet  everyone knew their reservations  how to get there  how to get back.,0.5267,0.036,0.951,0.014,p57
So  in that case  it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that.,0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,p57
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p57
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p57
Umm  let me see.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we weren’t all on the same page and not communicating.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
Uh huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
Umm  I can also try to think of something else if you don’t mind giving me just a minute.,0.34,0.118,0.882,0.0,p57
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
Umm  so I guess  in one of my classes last year  we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how  umm  and the way we kind of resolved that issue  because clearly  as an aspect  it needed to get done  we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out.,0.8807,0.145,0.855,0.0,p57
So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time  whereas for the rest of us  we were more interested in the actual material  so we found a mutually agreeable solution.,0.8955,0.263,0.737,0.0,p57
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
Tell…Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p57
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
Umm  I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything I’m doing  you know  that  like  I’m a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh  management really excites me too  I want to do that as well  which  in the past  has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit  which  as a result  when you’re really excited about everything  but then you try to do everything  the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing  but I’m conscious of this year.,0.8397,0.129,0.855,0.016,p57
I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and…especially because last year  while doing all of those  I wasn’t sleeping as much  which  you know  while I was still there and pulling my share and everything  you know  it was harder to be a full present member of anything if you’re tired.,-0.4215,0.038,0.874,0.087,p57
So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and I’m aware of that  so when I feel myself reaching my limit  I’ll actually try to prioritize more.,0.6369,0.158,0.842,0.0,p57
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p57
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p57
As I mentioned before  what I’m studying in school is very applicable to consulting  but  in addition to that  I’m really excited about the work that consultants do  especially  as I mentioned  I’m very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those  delve into them  and in consulting I’d get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both  which is  again  the problem solving  the thinking innovatively.,0.9017,0.154,0.809,0.037,p57
These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do  so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that I’ve spoken to really engaging and it seems  from all of my previous conversations with them  that they’re really excited about this  which is  you know  exactly what I would hope to bring as well.,0.9564,0.227,0.773,0.0,p57
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p58
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p58
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
I'm a junior at MIT studying Ocean Engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
And I'm really interested in working with big ships.,0.4576,0.272,0.728,0.0,p58
I love being on boats and by the water.,0.6369,0.344,0.656,0.0,p58
I am on the sailing team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
I spent the summer building underwater robots.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Wow  great!,0.8478,1.0,0.0,0.0,p58
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Um  this last year  um  I restarted the section of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
We had one about five years ago when Ocean Engineering was Course 13  but now it's merged with the Mechanical Engineering Department and when that happened the organization fell apart.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
But I knew that me and some of the other Ocean Engineers wanted to really have our own society.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
So I started it and I went to this meeting to how to get it all setup and got a professor to sponsor us.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
So you basically restarted the whole thing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Mmhmm Great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,p58
Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p58
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p58
This last January I was working with my team in robotics team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
And we  there was a big conflict in the team because we thought we were going to build a six foot long glider  which is pretty huge.,0.4939,0.173,0.755,0.072,p58
The parts are so large and so heavy we couldn't machine anything ourselves we had to get it all done in a machine shop externally.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
But we had to have a glider that size to like accomplish the goals for the glider which were look for oil.,0.7876,0.258,0.742,0.0,p58
Um  so like  but then were were also working on a smaller version of the glider that didn't have all the sensors we needed  but otherwise had the same capabilities.,0.2255,0.061,0.939,0.0,p58
And it was more easier and more fun because we could machine everything.,0.7708,0.378,0.622,0.0,p58
And um  it was easier to understand the small piece.,0.4215,0.237,0.763,0.0,p58
But there was an awkward moment in January when half the team was working on the big glider and half the team was working on the small glider and we didn't know if we wanted to trash the big glider and work on the small one.,-0.2263,0.0,0.959,0.041,p58
And so I was part of the team that decided that we should focus on the small glider.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
So we took the design from the big glider and took as much as we could to put on the small glider and assigned people to work on the small glider.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p58
Tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,p58
One of my weaknesses is  I think  being aware of the energy that I bring into a room.,-0.1027,0.102,0.777,0.121,p58
So when I am at meetings I really try to put positive energy into the room.,0.6908,0.289,0.711,0.0,p58
Even if one day I'm really feeling quiet I make an effort to say things or make an effort to react to say things.,0.2006,0.072,0.928,0.0,p58
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p58
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Haha Something along the lines of something relevant to what you'd want to hear.,0.5106,0.264,0.736,0.0,p58
You should hire me because  um  I can bring good energy to a team and engineering experience  especially related to the ocean and ships related to the ocean and underwater vehicles.,0.6124,0.147,0.853,0.0,p58
And I have experience working on teams.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p58
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p58
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Great [laughs] tired.,0.6597,0.716,0.0,0.284,p59
Good  me too.,0.4404,0.592,0.408,0.0,p59
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Um  alright  I go to MIT  course ten and seven.,0.25,0.182,0.818,0.0,p59
Um  I want to be a doctor.,0.0772,0.178,0.822,0.0,p59
I'm an EMT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
What else is there?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
A little sister.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Hmm  I grew up here in Florida  but I was born in Toronto.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Uh  yeah [laughs] Great.,0.8591,0.905,0.095,0.0,p59
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Um  probably when I worked as an EMT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
You know  you're there to support your colleagues.,0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0,p59
And  you know  people have to trust you  if there're going to want to call you.,0.5574,0.247,0.753,0.0,p59
And that's the whole of this service  is that we want people to trust us  and  you know  taking on the extra work load and working  'cus I'm an MIT student  and  you know  taking nightshifts or working in between classes and.,0.5574,0.103,0.897,0.0,p59
Pretty great responsibility  so.,0.8074,0.785,0.215,0.0,p59
Tell me about the time you're on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.098,0.902,0.0,p59
And how did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.189,0.526,0.284,p59
Um  I rode for six years  so  you know  it's obviously a team requirement  so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Basically every time you show up to a race  that's a challenge  right?,0.0772,0.098,0.902,0.0,p59
And  I have a quote that hangs on my wall  and it's training is the opposite of hoping.,0.4215,0.141,0.859,0.0,p59
So  it's just working really hard to  sort of  prepare  for  you know  trying to achieve your goal.,-0.1761,0.0,0.909,0.091,p59
Because I think all the training  you know  that's how you make your own fate or  preparing  you know  preparing for a test  whatever.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
And to work for it  you know  things don't come very easy  so.,-0.3865,0.0,0.821,0.179,p59
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p59
And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p59
I am a huge perfectionist.,0.5859,0.615,0.385,0.0,p59
So  you know  you [inaudible] into trivial things that  you know  you know  I shouldn't waste so much time perfecting and I- I will  so.,0.6999,0.203,0.759,0.038,p59
That's- that's probably the worst thing.,-0.6249,0.0,0.549,0.451,p59
My boyfriend tells me all the time  he's like You have to stop expecting everything to be perfect I'm like I know  so.,0.7579,0.291,0.635,0.074,p59
Uh  just trying to  like  put things in perspective I guess  so.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p59
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p59
Definitely became harder to do at MIT.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,p59
You know  you can't be perfect because  you know  everyone here essentially is  so.,-0.4585,0.0,0.813,0.187,p59
Everyone's very good at doing stuff  so.,0.4927,0.347,0.653,0.0,p59
And why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
Um  I mean  because I work really hard.,-0.1761,0.0,0.805,0.195,p59
I love it.,0.6369,0.677,0.323,0.0,p59
I don't see myself doing anything else with my life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
It's weird [inaudible] Why are you doing that?,-0.1779,0.0,0.805,0.195,p59
I don't know you know  I thought it was this thing  but.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
I don't see myself  you know  sitting in a cubicle or behind a computer being like a code monkey.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,p59
Um  I need a career  I'm up on my feet and.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
I love interacting with people.,0.6369,0.512,0.488,0.0,p59
I love the science behind medicine.,0.6369,0.457,0.543,0.0,p59
And  um  you know  being able to change someone's life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
I know it's probably a pretty cliched answer  but it's the only thing that like  I can see myself doing.,0.6542,0.229,0.771,0.0,p59
You know  adding productively into society  so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p59
So  how are you doing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
I’m doing good.,0.4404,0.592,0.408,0.0,p6
How are you?Thank you.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
So  please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p6
Well  um  my name is Jeff  um.,0.2732,0.259,0.741,0.0,p6
I was born in Japan.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
I lived there for seven years before I moved to the  uh  US.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
First  to Michigan for two years and then to Maryland.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  and it was when I was in high school  or I’m sorry  middle school that I was exposed to um  a lot of different math  uh  science  advanced science courses.,0.1027,0.061,0.859,0.08,p6
Um  it was where  um  I was exposed to a lot of um math competitions and computer science competitions.,-0.0772,0.0,0.933,0.067,p6
And  it was around my uh  junior year in high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
It was around my junior year in school because of peer and parental pressures I decided to do pre-med.,-0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,p6
I decided to pursue  uh  a career in medicine.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  so it was in high school that I decided start taking biology classes  physics  physiology  and  um  when I got here to MIT I decided to major in Course 20.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  and  after about four lab positions  two of the (inaudible) and two of chemistry that I realized  um  the Course 20  the medicine track wasn’t for me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  mainly because it wasn’t quantitative enough or competitive enough  or fast paced enough for me.,0.1779,0.102,0.898,0.0,p6
But  with my last internship in the biotech industry  I had the privilege of talking to talk with several site directors.,0.5023,0.14,0.86,0.0,p6
Um  it was because of and through that meeting I realized that I might really like finance  and that it might be more suitable for me.,0.4201,0.1,0.9,0.0,p6
Um  and afterwards I started talking to some colleagues.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  some finance majors.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  that’s why I’m here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  I would say it was during high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
There was this one group sophomore year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
We had to do this mission  this project called Mission Impossible where we had to design a rover that would uh  traverse  a uh  a uh  platform with quantum data.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
The problem with the group was there was supposed to be a leader  but nobody really took an responsibility to do what they had to do.,-0.2144,0.0,0.931,0.069,p6
That was partly due to the fact that nobody really individuals were assigned anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
So  that was when I had to  I decided to take the initiative a couple of days before it was due.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Actually  with the whole project  to uh  become the leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
The unofficial itself leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
As a leader I  uh  assigned a tasks to people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Politely  I asked them to do this because this was a very um (coughs)  multi- prospective project that um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
It required programming construction and educating.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  yeah  I decided to be leader and assign tasks.,0.296,0.196,0.804,0.0,p6
And  I would say it was pretty successful the robot got in time it was due.,0.7906,0.333,0.667,0.0,p6
Tell me about a time you were working a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p6
How did you solve the problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p6
Ok  well I would like to talk about my past at my most recent internship at a biotech company.,0.7003,0.298,0.702,0.0,p6
Um  and the problem was that I was working as an individual group.,-0.4019,0.0,0.816,0.184,p6
It was because I was working with cells.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  cells  the way cells work  is that um  that you culture them  like on say day 1.,0.3612,0.128,0.872,0.0,p6
And  you let them grow like four or five or six  and then you let them grow until you collect  data.,0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,p6
And  the problem is you’re not even can’t collect the data on day one  you have to collect on day six.,-0.4019,0.0,0.881,0.119,p6
And  if anything happens on day 3 or day four or something or sometime between day one and day five  the data will make no sense.,-0.296,0.0,0.919,0.081,p6
You would have to re-start the experiment.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  I was on a tight schedule and this was a ten week project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  in the first two weeks  I contaminated the cells.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Um  both weeks  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  so my data had to be re-done  my experiment had to be re-done.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
The problem was that this was a ten week project and I had eight weeks to do.,-0.4019,0.0,0.856,0.144,p6
One thing I learned about internships is to not panic when situations like such as this arise.,0.6372,0.257,0.743,0.0,p6
And  uh  what I did was  I went to people for help.,0.4019,0.197,0.803,0.0,p6
Um  and I definitely spent more hours.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,p6
I talked to the HR department  I talked to my managers to increase my hours from 40 to 60 hours.,0.3182,0.108,0.892,0.0,p6
Uh  so instead I went Saturdays and Sundays too.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
In fact  there was this one point where I worked 23 days in a row  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  uh  successfully  I think finished it.,0.4939,0.348,0.652,0.0,p6
In fact  after my data analysis and data compiling  uh  I presented my data to the site director.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
He told me I had the most impressive presentation out of all the 21 other interns there.,0.5563,0.183,0.817,0.0,p6
Um  So  Yeah  it was during challenges like that  because of challenges like that that I’ve learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help.,0.8978,0.418,0.506,0.076,p6
Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,p6
I think one of my weaknesses is that I don’t have a formal education in finance.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p6
Um  I decided to be Course 20  and um  uh  and I decided to pursue pre-med.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  I was  I agree  uh  that it was a very sudden transition to math Course 18.,0.3612,0.135,0.865,0.0,p6
I think make up for that at least partially by  uh going to workshops  uh going to reading books  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
I definitely have been networking with colleagues.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,p6
So  in terms of the financial models  uh  the mental math skills and the preliminary skills that I mean to  I believe I have a very strong grasp of those.,0.5563,0.11,0.89,0.0,p6
Now  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Well  I think  um  that compared to the rest of the competition  no one shows more initiative than I do.,-0.0258,0.094,0.807,0.099,p6
And  in fact  I don’t anyone has the technical skills or the willingness to work such long hours.,0.2732,0.11,0.89,0.0,p6
Um  I think one of my strengths is that I don’t have any problems with high expectations because I had to do such a sudden transition in career.,0.0,0.086,0.828,0.086,p6
I had to do a lot research to convince myself that I won’t have to do this transition again.,0.25,0.1,0.9,0.0,p6
Like I said  I’ve networked  I’ve done tons of research  I’ve read books  I’ve done tons and tons of research.,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,p6
And you know  out to site directors  you know even out to first year analysts.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  I know exactly what my job is.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
And  I know that the long hours are tough and anyone else who says they like the long hours would be lying to you.,-0.34,0.088,0.739,0.173,p6
And  I know the exact skill sets required  and I believe I have those skill sets.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p6
Well  thank you again for coming.,0.5574,0.535,0.465,0.0,p6
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p6
Thank you for this opportunity.,0.6956,0.657,0.343,0.0,p6
Yes  it was great to meet you.,0.7783,0.576,0.424,0.0,p6
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
Interveiwee: Good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p60
Gooood  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
So  umm I'm from Chicago... and I'm a junior here at MIT  umm when I came here I was pretty sure I wanted to do health related work  so I guess I came in as a biology major.,0.6705,0.133,0.867,0.0,p60
And my dad is also a MDHP really interested - or really involved in research Mhm.,0.4576,0.166,0.834,0.0,p60
Um  and so sort of that influenced me a lot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
So then I realized  after doing biology for two years essentially  that I wasn't really enjoying it (laughs).,0.1207,0.154,0.712,0.133,p60
And so  I decided to try out computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
Because this is MIT after all and if I did want to do biology in the future  which it's not that I don't like biology  it's that I didn't feel like I was learning skills that would contribute to the field I guess.,-0.4442,0.029,0.879,0.093,p60
And so  um yeah.,0.3566,0.452,0.548,0.0,p60
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p60
So then I decided to do computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
That's a very small part of me (laughs).,0.4939,0.314,0.686,0.0,p60
That's a very broad question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
Um  so I am the co-president of an organization at MIT called Glo-Met  and what we do is  we're partnered with a non-profit gratitude organization abroad  so our group is basically non profit.,0.7351,0.167,0.833,0.0,p60
We work with HIV health care work in Togo  and so I guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester I suppose  it's been a work in progress  it's the first time I've ever been like in a president's role in a group of about 30 people.,0.8176,0.156,0.844,0.0,p60
And all the records are new this year  its a new organization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
So it's sort of like realizing  you know there's so many aspects of leadership  it's not just like  not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show that's being maintained properly.,0.0125,0.035,0.932,0.034,p60
Um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group.,-0.5563,0.0,0.807,0.193,p60
Um so I guess I've been learning a lot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
Do you have specific questions about that?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
No  I want to hear about your experience.,-0.3447,0.0,0.637,0.363,p60
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p60
So yea in terms of like leading a group of people that are like you know  my age  umm and we're all like new at it  it's definitely a work in progress.,0.9001,0.325,0.675,0.0,p60
But we do a number of things in terms of umm  we fund raise for... so we hold campaigns and we fund raise  in order to basically fund our projects abroad in Togo  so we are trying.. our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that we're partnered with in Togo  so we... it's hard sometimes motivating a group of people when your partner is abroad  it's not like  we haven't met them yet  and it's a new partnership  so we're traveling there this summer but since it's new its kind of as a leader I think it takes a lot of like  not only vision and fore planning but like also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up.,0.9603,0.159,0.798,0.043,p60
You can't just do everything yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
Mhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
Even if that seems easier.,0.4215,0.412,0.588,0.0,p60
Umm and then also like  maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives.,0.7506,0.261,0.739,0.0,p60
So that's the biggest challenge I think  but.,0.0387,0.141,0.859,0.0,p60
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p60
Tell me about a time you're working on a team a face a challenge  how do you solve that problem?,-0.1531,0.136,0.746,0.118,p60
Umm... so I guess the same organization  we had a lot of umm  problems.,-0.4019,0.0,0.828,0.172,p60
Um  so  we are a team as an organization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
So last year I was like a director on the exec board  but not umm one of the co-presidents  and the biggest challenge we've had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated  had very poor communication  and we didn't have  we just didn't really get anything done.,-0.7656,0.055,0.81,0.135,p60
Umm so a challenge on my part was not really  I wasn't sure  I knew what needed to get done and I knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know  motivate our staff  because it's not like  it's not just about us  we obviously  there are people that like depend on us.. and umm  the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time  while trying to.. trying to get them motivated but you know  telling  and I think a challenge was that they felt it was  they felt personally attacked when people criticize them.,-0.3782,0.116,0.78,0.104,p60
Or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so I think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you can't do everything  if that person is the president you just have to let them do what they're gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right  but don't try to push  like you can't always push through things  sometimes you gotta just like go.,0.8474,0.145,0.833,0.022,p60
Mhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
And like... and I guess that's... that did kind of solve the problem.,0.079,0.24,0.599,0.162,p60
I mean  I didn't solve the problem of like  things not getting done.,0.4881,0.291,0.612,0.097,p60
But like I think realizing that actually helps a lot.,0.7684,0.454,0.546,0.0,p60
Because it was just like banging your head against the wall.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p60
So.. yeah!,0.3595,0.714,0.286,0.0,p60
(Laughs) Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,0.1779,0.162,0.711,0.127,p60
That's like also a weakness I guess.. I guess a weakness of mine would be that I am pretty umm.. Knowing how to step back and not umm.. basically not trying to do everything myself when it's definitely supposed to be a team effort  and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency.,0.8225,0.201,0.72,0.079,p60
So umm... definitely giving people the chance to do the job right.,0.7678,0.459,0.541,0.0,p60
And sometimes you make second chances.,0.2023,0.265,0.735,0.0,p60
So I think that's.. I might have a bad temper sometimes.,-0.743,0.0,0.588,0.412,p60
That can be part of it (laughs).,0.4939,0.348,0.652,0.0,p60
So yeah.,0.3597,0.714,0.286,0.0,p60
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p60
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p60
I think because I'm very motivated.,0.5095,0.397,0.603,0.0,p60
And I have a lot of self initiative and I'm hard on myself  so that sometimes I expect highly of other people in the same way  and that can  I mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that you've asked about  but I think that is umm good in  when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time.,0.8442,0.12,0.847,0.033,p60
And somebody who really takes like  self responsibility for things.,0.4173,0.236,0.764,0.0,p60
So.. I think if it's for like a project for example  like a small group project its like good to have someone that isn't shy to speak up in a group.,0.879,0.318,0.682,0.0,p60
And somebody that can sort of like organize the group to  to coordinate the group better.,0.6258,0.267,0.733,0.0,p60
Like vocally.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p60
(Laughs),0.4939,1.0,0.0,0.0,p60
Tell me about yourself I am in aerospace and engineering  and a   Junior  uhm I’m in naval ROTC  and I’m trying to be a naval   Aviator.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p61
Ready?,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p61
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p61
well with ROTC you get a lot of   different opportunities each semester  uhm  depending   On hold old you are  ah  you will be a squad leader   Which is where you lead about 6 different people  ah   now that I’m a jra I’m ah admino  which is basically   where i do a lot of paper work and i help shape the   background planning for the entire battalion.,0.7506,0.105,0.895,0.0,p61
mm wow ok tell me about a time when working on a team and facing a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,0.6597,0.305,0.604,0.091,p61
ah in unified last year  uhm we had the   airplane challenge uhm and different people had   different personalities some wanting and more   controlling than others  ultimately we ended up ah   dividing it for who had the better strengths ah and   ultimately  we do really hope that the project was good  ok and can you tell me one of your weaknesses that hopefully will never come in?,0.9432,0.256,0.713,0.031,p61
One of my big weaknesses would be ah   speeches in front of a lot of people  and what are you doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.902,0.098,p61
well ROTC is kinda forcing me into   positions to just practice all the time i feel that   ultimately that will help  and why do you think we should hire you (slight laugh) (finishes sentence) in the meaning ah because I'm physically qualified and   trained very well and i feel my battalion has set me   up to do well in the future  great,0.9407,0.244,0.756,0.0,p61
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p62
Alright  Ready to go?,0.5423,0.692,0.308,0.0,p62
Mmm  hmmm How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p62
I’m good   Good How are you?,0.7003,0.592,0.408,0.0,p62
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p62
Tell me about yourself Umm  So my name is Juliann  ok  uhh  just hold up  so what  what exactly would this interview?,0.296,0.095,0.905,0.0,p62
You can say background Ok It’s a behavioral  short behavioral interview for I guess for Med School Ok   Ok?,0.5267,0.206,0.794,0.0,p62
So I’m Juliann  I go to MIT  I’m currently a junior  I’m hoping to attend your  the medical school that I’m applying to   Mmm  hmmm Umm yeah I’m studying computer science and biology  which is a pretty new umm course here at MIT  and currently I’m taking mostly biology classes  I’m also doing research in the hematology lab  and umm  yeah so a little bit about myself umm I guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college  I was born in Tai… I was born in California… in Irvine  umm and my parents and I moved back to Taiwan when I was about 10  so I went to International school there  umm but yeah  most of my friends were pretty bilingual.,0.9516,0.144,0.856,0.0,p62
They spoke both English and Chinese so I would say that I’m pretty you know fluent at both languages.,0.4939,0.151,0.849,0.0,p62
And yeah really look to both California and Taiwan as my homes.,0.296,0.167,0.833,0.0,p62
Great  Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.6249,0.339,0.661,0.0,p62
Ok  umm let’s see… So I as I said I’m from Taiwan and I’m  I’m part of a student group here at MIT  called the association of Taiwanese students  and what I actually was  was a cultural chair uh  for a year  and one of our main events is to create a night market  so umm  yeah  so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in Asia  uhh we actually took it inside into our student center  so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs  so this included like the Chinese students club  umm  the association of  sorry the Asian American Association  as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event  and so what my partner and I were in charge of was the food  and what we thought  we thought that this was you know  one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place  so umm  yeah I think that you know ha… getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm  you know time everybody needed to set up  umm and we  yeah so my partner and I were in charge of that  and I thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something  umm  you know  arise out of that.,0.9339,0.071,0.924,0.005,p62
Great  and tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,0.5423,0.249,0.657,0.093,p62
A team  umm  lets see  ok so over the summer umm  I actually  this last summer before my junior year  umm  I went to Taiwan and China.,0.296,0.078,0.922,0.0,p62
Taiwan and Hong Kong specifically to teach… Mmm hmmm And this was in groups of three  so there were two other MIT students and I umm teaching in a group… Mmm hmmm And so what this conflict arose  umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we weren’t sure because there were  there was also another group  another group of three teaching at the same time and we weren’t sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more  more time with all of the six instructors  umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks… Mmmm And so you know kind of a conflict arose out of that umm it was pretty much you know  three versus three  like three of us wanted  we thought that it would be a good idea to switch and umm the other three thought that you know they wanted to have a more personal relationship with their students.,0.8572,0.084,0.889,0.028,p62
And umm  yeah eventually what you know we we sat down at first it was pretty heated  umm  like so two of uhh  my colleagues  like one person from my team  and someone from the other  umm had you know really strong  strong ideas about umm what they wanted to do.,0.9483,0.281,0.719,0.0,p62
So  you know what I said was  hey  everybody like let’s sit down and calm down  and you know think this through and talk it through  and you know I  I felt like I was one of the mediators in that  you know I didn’t let myself get you know too involved at first  and I didn’t let you know start screaming or anything like that  and I was really the one that said hey everybody sit down  umm  let’s talk this through  and so we really just you know calmly and logically thought it through  talked it through  and you know we were like oh what would be the advantages of of switching and what would be the disadvantages?,0.8689,0.128,0.832,0.04,p62
And in the end we felt like umm the students were there to get breath and not necessarily depth  Since it was only two weeks anyway  and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to umm have more exposure to all of the MIT instructors from all different backgrounds.,0.8,0.138,0.862,0.0,p62
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p62
Ok  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?,-0.0772,0.132,0.719,0.15,p62
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p62
I feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh  self confidence.,0.8176,0.488,0.39,0.122,p62
I  you know  I’m not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything Mmm hmm Umm  and you know there are people  like some of my friends are very much so people who are in the center of attention a lot.,0.6808,0.115,0.885,0.0,p62
And I think that that’s something that I have been working on and will strive to work on umm in the future as well.,0.2732,0.084,0.916,0.0,p62
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p62
And why do you think you should get into this medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p62
Well I think that  you know  I (laughs) I I’ve demonstrated a lot of umm I have a lot of experience in the medical field  umm as a college student umm I do research in as I said in the hematology lab and I actually also work as an EMT.,0.6486,0.099,0.901,0.0,p62
Mmmmm So that’s been a very  very large  big part of my life since umm last January.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p62
Umm  when I got my EMT  EMS umm license  and yeah so I actually work here at MIT umm as a Emergency Medical Technician  Uhh  I work probably 15 hours a week on that.,-0.1027,0.06,0.87,0.071,p62
Umm  but moreso beyond my experience I really have a passion for the medical field.,0.6592,0.239,0.761,0.0,p62
Umm  and I you know want to see help both the research that I do that you know  hopefully  in the future uhh  some clinical  the clinical work that I do will effect medical field.,0.6908,0.173,0.827,0.0,p62
So uh  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
Pretty good  how are you?,0.7269,0.67,0.33,0.0,p63
I'm well.,0.2732,0.677,0.323,0.0,p63
Um  please tell me about yourself.,0.3182,0.315,0.685,0.0,p63
All right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
Um  I guess  to start with the basics  I'm uh  a junior at MIT right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
I'm studying course six three  it's computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And uh  I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And um  that's after I transferred here from the University of Michigan.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And then uh  since then pretty much everything I do has been computer science.,0.4939,0.198,0.802,0.0,p63
No  awesome.,-0.5096,0.0,0.233,0.767,p63
Our courses department is pretty excellent here.,0.7845,0.58,0.42,0.0,p63
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p63
So uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
All right  um  so this past um  this past summer um  I uh  got  well I guess last year  I got involved with an organization on campus called Camp Kasim.,0.2732,0.068,0.932,0.0,p63
Uh-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And so  Camp Kasim runs a camp for the children of cancer patients.,-0.6597,0.0,0.732,0.268,p63
And it's um  it's kind of a therapeutic camp  so the aim is for kids to just have fun.,0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,p63
And  anyway  we have various units that we break the kids up into to  that are divided up by age.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And um  I wasn't the unit leader for my unit but uh  there was a time when our unit leader had to go off and uh  it was either his break or he had to uh  go off and take care of some other stuff.,0.6486,0.089,0.911,0.0,p63
And so  uh  I was kind of given control of the unit.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And so um  it was an interesting experience  because we were dealing with kids.,0.4019,0.172,0.828,0.0,p63
But um  obviously the counselors were adults and college students  my peers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
So um  there's this kind of flip flopping between interacting with my peers and like  making sure they were on top of their um  you know  their jobs as counselors.,0.6808,0.196,0.804,0.0,p63
Watching the kids and making sure the kids are having fun.,0.6808,0.384,0.616,0.0,p63
Also  like  playing around with the kids and making sure the kids are like  not thinking about anything  but having  but having a good time.,0.8126,0.342,0.658,0.0,p63
So um  this kind of  I just like  should that answer the question?,0.3612,0.172,0.828,0.0,p63
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p63
Yeah  I think so  it's always import to help the problem.,0.296,0.314,0.513,0.173,p63
Uh  so tell me about a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p63
How did you overcome the problem?,-0.4019,0.0,0.649,0.351,p63
All right um  so in  I guess  the last time I can really remember being part of uh  really intense team experience was um  in high school  I was on the year book as a photographer.,0.1513,0.044,0.956,0.0,p63
So um  we  I  my friend and I were both the head photographers.,0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,p63
So we  organized all the photos.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And so  we would coordinate with the editors.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And um  in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed  like what events needed to have photos taken of them  or what teams needed photos.,0.3612,0.082,0.918,0.0,p63
And  we would go about organizing the actual um  like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos.,0.3612,0.091,0.909,0.0,p63
And  so um  there we times when  like just getting  making sure that our photographers got to events uh  and like  and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um  was  could be very challenging.,0.8777,0.274,0.726,0.0,p63
Because  I mean  because we were all very busy students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
And so um  one  like just  I guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like  really commit to their job and follow through on that.,0.7939,0.274,0.726,0.0,p63
And so  part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like  team culture.,0.7485,0.285,0.715,0.0,p63
And  a sense of like  comradery among the photographers themselves.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p63
Ah  yes.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,p63
Um  you know  try to get people to um  like try to get people to go to event  even though  and they weren't assigned.,0.3612,0.098,0.902,0.0,p63
Just out of  like the eagerness to take photos and photography.,0.6369,0.366,0.634,0.0,p63
And so  um  we kind of approached this challenge and motivated  it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our  our um  peers.,0.8435,0.345,0.655,0.0,p63
And so  um  or like incentivizing these photos.,0.4144,0.283,0.717,0.0,p63
And  we approached by trying to  like build a sense of community and uh  like  like  and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos.,0.8885,0.373,0.627,0.0,p63
Um  it was  it ended up playing out very well  but there's still a couple photographers who just  you know.,0.2724,0.147,0.853,0.0,p63
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p63
They just didn't want to do the job  sometimes.,-0.0572,0.0,0.867,0.133,p63
I mean  they  they usually had like  valid  some what valid excuses  but.,0.1901,0.127,0.873,0.0,p63
That inevitable.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
Yeah  but yeah this job still need to get done.,0.5267,0.355,0.645,0.0,p63
So uh  yeah  I mean  that was uh  pretty interesting team experience.,0.8115,0.482,0.518,0.0,p63
That went well.,0.2732,0.512,0.488,0.0,p63
So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.865,0.135,p63
Sure  um  yes.,0.6124,0.833,0.167,0.0,p63
Let's see  um  maybe one of my  I'd say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly.,0.0516,0.127,0.755,0.118,p63
Uh  at times I struggle to uh  I struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what I'm thinking.,-0.5106,0.05,0.772,0.178,p63
And so  I like  I find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence.,0.4728,0.27,0.73,0.0,p63
And um  there's some situations were  just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh  can be problematic.,-0.1027,0.095,0.795,0.11,p63
And in other  in other situations  like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful  because I've  you know  I don't say anything  I don't tend to say anything rash.,0.4019,0.15,0.776,0.075,p63
And so  um  it has it's merits.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,p63
But usually  its just in general  it's nicer just to have a faster pace so  in kind of like conveying thoughts.,0.7691,0.26,0.74,0.0,p63
So  now thinking back to the job that we talked about  now why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
Um  um  so I'd say that I'm committed  hard working  uh  person.,0.1779,0.156,0.741,0.104,p63
And  in terms of this job I guess  uh  and my edge  can I describe what it is?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p63
All right  so in my head it's a software engineering position and so  I believe as um  I can contribute a lot to this  with the skills that I've gained here at uh  MIT.,0.3818,0.073,0.927,0.0,p63
And  then also  I believe that I can gain a lot from the company  in terms of learning um  about what they do and how they do it.,0.5267,0.112,0.888,0.0,p63
And  I think it would be a good partnership.,0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,p63
Well  thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,p63
For coming to your interview today.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p63
Please tell me about yourself.,0.3182,0.365,0.635,0.0,p64
So  umm I was wandering  umm I'm actually from Russia.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
I grew up in Tulun  though  and I normally go to Cambridge University- Really?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
-which is  which is where I study.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Here I am  uhh a foreign exchange student uhh with MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Uhh I study course six umm mainly I focus my interest  split them more like uhh between umm the afternoon where I focus more on devices look like  nano electronics uhh processing methods umm circuits and also stuff that has to do with uhh I think it has to do with AI control machine loading umm so what I'm interested in.,0.8822,0.165,0.835,0.0,p64
I've been taking courses to that uhh goal  so things like 6034  6052  6017  umm in those same areas I've done several projects umm like something Cambridge over summer  I did a I wrote a uhh simulator umm the simulator basically simulates a landing on Mars and has to take in account physics umm graphics  planetary rotation umm and I have to write an AI which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch umm in a space craft.,0.6461,0.062,0.938,0.0,p64
Umm similarly  I've also been participating in a robotics uhh competition in Cambridge.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Umm it was similar to MIT's Mass Lab umm and I was on the software team again uhh although I have done a little bit of electronics and the goal of that project was to  in a team of six  create a robot which is able to navigate a black uh sorry a white grid on a black table umm and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet based on whether uhh it was magnetic or not take it into a certain box  and I programmed the uh AI for that.,0.4404,0.041,0.946,0.013,p64
So that's the most experience I've had.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Umm in Cambridge here uhh I've considered participating in uhh umm Battlecode or Mass Lab perhaps.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Umm there's been some quite interesting projects going on umm in class; those should be quite interesting.,0.7172,0.285,0.715,0.0,p64
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p64
That was  that was a wonderful experience.,0.5719,0.381,0.619,0.0,p64
Yeah  yeah it was good  pretty good.,0.9081,0.87,0.13,0.0,p64
So umm tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Umm  so umm again  in the robotics project uhh competition at Cambridge umm in in our team of six I had to  in some ways  help out and direct the design choices in our  umm  for the competition.,0.4019,0.068,0.932,0.0,p64
Uhh some things include deciding which sensors to be placed and where and kind of the overall idea was basically because I am running the AI  I have to umm have a clear idea of what the robot has to do  what its components are and I was the one to be the go-to guy in case somebody had to make the decision up based on that.,0.3818,0.038,0.962,0.0,p64
And I made decisions uhh just based on rationality where umm if something was  the idea was that something has to be umm only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any more complications make problems  stuff doesn't work  breaks  umm so yeah.,-0.3176,0.054,0.849,0.097,p64
And I also helped out with the electronics and sometimes the woodshure which umm sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that and I had to blast them on umm well what I wanted to be done for the AI to work properly.,0.5574,0.093,0.907,0.0,p64
Umm another case of leadership  I guess  was I did military service in Finland uh uhh as a citizen- Yeah.,0.296,0.104,0.896,0.0,p64
-and  umm  so we had this  at the end of the service near to the end  there was a umm a anti air camp where all the anti air regiments and battalions were coming together at this one big training camp and as a member of the communication squad  umm we had to go and set up some things for the light fly exercises and because our sergeant was away doing some things  umm I really didn't know what he was doing  but I-I had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people that  you know  these two guys  you know  do this cable and these guys set up the radio  I'll do this and so yeah it was quite alright I guess that way.,0.8761,0.082,0.895,0.022,p64
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Uhh that's all the license.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Umm so I guess we can go over some of the details.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Can you tell me a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?,-0.1531,0.125,0.766,0.109,p64
Umm well with the with the six people uhh we split each ourselves in three teams  three sub teams.,0.2732,0.104,0.896,0.0,p64
One was mechanical  one was electrical  and one was uhh AI.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Now because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team  umm we said that it'd be better if he was to help out with the mechanics 'cause there was umm a lot of hand work to be done uhh a lot of design work there and the AI is easily written by me  when umm I just kind of have a clear idea it was much faster then splitting with other people  it was rather simple AI I guess.,0.9153,0.143,0.857,0.0,p64
Umm now  with the mechanics it's much more important they get all this stuff done  leave some time in the workshop work so it was a decision we had to make umm to get more of that kind of get more of that hand work to the mechanical team  more man power to the mechanical team.,0.6549,0.093,0.887,0.02,p64
Uhh with the electrical team umm we decided that we wanted the meaning doing most of the design work for the electronics 'cause you get a better idea and they also gonna be doing most of the soldering of electronic parts 'cause so we got uhh some basic components we we got this controller block umm with with a CPU inside but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and other controllers and all that so we had to do all those circuits.,0.0,0.022,0.955,0.022,p64
Umm so one of the guys  Oscar  umm was much more into that so he took charge into design and uhh Calvin did much more the soldering and stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
I kind of helped out when they needed some help.,0.4019,0.231,0.769,0.0,p64
Umm so yeah we just needed to have a clear delegation of tasks and just do a bit of try if somebody needs something done we'd be able to produce a kind of working-ish result- Ahh.,0.624,0.13,0.87,0.0,p64
-so that we could get stuff out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
So as an example  I-I made a control system which uhh follows the lines way before I wrote any of the code for picking up stuff or testing what it is and how to choose where it goes.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
The idea was that I am able to follow the line and turn umm which kind of tricky actually  so the way the sensors set up and the motors weren't properly balanced and such.,-0.2247,0.0,0.946,0.054,p64
Umm so the mechanic guys managed to work together umm at a quick rate with just some of the basic plates they didn't they didn't cut them or anything.,-0.1537,0.0,0.946,0.054,p64
They just got a plate  put some motors on  uhh hooked up the motors into the CPU  and did that and it worked.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
I was able to make the AI which follows the lines which was pretty good.,0.7269,0.319,0.681,0.0,p64
Umm also that that that did mean that the umm the Oscar who made the sensor connectors umm he had to kind of work faster and make those particular circuits work before he made any other control circuits.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
But delegating those things that way it  well will do a step by step  and do it gradually.,0.3919,0.135,0.865,0.0,p64
Umm so tell me what are your weaknesses and you're going about to improving them.,0.0772,0.153,0.71,0.137,p64
Umm I guess one of my weaknesses is that I often get carried away umm I guess somewhat arrogantly.,-0.6133,0.0,0.772,0.228,p64
Umm when I'm working with something  and I think I have a really good idea of what I am doing  umm something is better than other umm I have a better idea of wondering than therefore try to tell them maybe they're doing it slightly wrong be sort of somewhat more self-absorbed in what resources need to be allocated because I'm doing a lot of stuff and they might be doing it more slowly so I can use this for longer or something.,0.734,0.099,0.87,0.031,p64
Umm not not to the point of insulting people but more sort of center of attention kind thing  I guess.,0.5423,0.186,0.729,0.085,p64
Umm I'm trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that even though I think I have an idea of what I'm doing  I don't actually or that I might be mistaken.,-0.3612,0.0,0.938,0.062,p64
So I kind of try to be more kind of chilled and laid back just yeah so yeah  but it's a work in progress.,0.7378,0.256,0.744,0.0,p64
Umm so now finally  think of the job you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p64
So now why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p64
Umm well you should hire me because I am capable of uhh pretty good verbal communication umm I don't really stress out much  I think  so I'm quite relaxed that way.,0.9442,0.406,0.594,0.0,p64
I'm able to speak three languages  so I'm able to communicate quite well  umm Norwich  Finnish  and English.,0.3384,0.123,0.877,0.0,p64
Umm and I tend to be quite good at being able to delegate tasks to people so I'd be good for like a project lead  I guess because I have a pretty good technical background and I understand the tech and I quite enjoy working with the tech and I also like being with a team environment where I can delegate tasks and work on umm different things.,0.9636,0.256,0.744,0.0,p64
On on some things we can accomplish by ourselves on a larger project working on a team is quite fun if it works out right.,0.7501,0.218,0.782,0.0,p64
Well thank you for coming.,0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,p64
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Yeah  pretty good.,0.8074,1.0,0.0,0.0,p65
Um  don't feel particularly different from any other day.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
[laughs] Uh  so  please tell me about yourself.,0.6997,0.491,0.509,0.0,p65
Um  so I'm from Nearbell Fosten [SP]  Northern Ireland.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
I have three younger brothers  um  so  I think they have kind of influenced me as much as I probably have influenced them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Like  Mark  the next one down  he's only a year younger than me  so he was always a lot sportier.,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,p65
Uh  coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that  I got into those sports.,0.2023,0.083,0.917,0.0,p65
Um  and then Ian  the next one down after him  is a lot more artsy and stuff  so I think because of his influence I'm kind of a bit more appreciative of things that I would have maybe just kind of  like  disregarded before.,0.5423,0.123,0.825,0.052,p65
Um  Like  um  when we was down in New York there we went to MOMA and there was like  um  the Scream by Munch or Moonch .,0.3182,0.158,0.757,0.085,p65
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p65
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
whatever  which was there  and some Van Gogh Starry Night and some lilies by Monet.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
So I [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
with that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
But you know what?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
He will probably want to hear about this so I'll go and I'll take some photos for him.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p65
Um  and then Harry is the youngest one  he's kind of like just gets away with everything  being the youngest.,0.2975,0.104,0.896,0.0,p65
But  um  should be pretty good to go back around Christmas and catch it with them and stuff.,0.8462,0.337,0.663,0.0,p65
Um  probably not get back over to Cambridge in the UK over Christmas break but I try to keep in contact with friends from there  through like Facebook and stuff.,0.8126,0.209,0.791,0.0,p65
Um  and yeah  just really enjoying my time here at the moment.,0.7089,0.371,0.629,0.0,p65
That's a little bit of background on me and my family.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Uh  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p65
So tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Uh  so  this  I'm here on my third year  what you call junior year  my first two years in Cambridge I was part of like the Student Council for the college there while I was in college.,0.3612,0.065,0.935,0.0,p65
So as part of that we do have like  we call it Thrashers Week  where as you kind of call it Freshman Rush  dorm exploration or whatever  um  so we had a big kind of end to that week  finale event that kind of took over college  like  multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the UK is 18  so everyone at university could drink  so there were different promotions on different  um  bars all over the place in the college  different attractions and stuff.,0.8481,0.12,0.88,0.0,p65
So  um  just kind of planning that  deciding what the theme would be  um  how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that  and getting music acts  um  getting promotions on the main bar  and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters  fire extinguisher points  emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections  particularly  [??],0.7059,0.124,0.819,0.057,p65
being responsible for a particular area  I think that's quite a practical hands-on  time when I've been given leadership and I think I done well with it.,0.5267,0.15,0.85,0.0,p65
Uh  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p65
Sounds like a fun time.,0.7003,0.659,0.341,0.0,p65
It was  yeah.,0.296,0.524,0.476,0.0,p65
So  uh  tell me about a time you worked in a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p65
How did you go about solving it?,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,p65
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
So  um  again going thinking back to Cambridge in the UK  um  we  one of the things that Cambridge is known quite well for is Rowing  so I got to Cambridge and I was like  ah  I've never tried rowing before  I'll take this up.,0.5984,0.102,0.898,0.0,p65
So  um  in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it up and we continued it into our second year  but one of friends then decided he didn't have time for it and just kin- kinda dropped it to the wayside  but we had the big kind of races that are towards the end of the summer there  they're called the Maybumps [SP].,0.7351,0.085,0.915,0.0,p65
And obviously any kind of sport team work is important  but in rowing so much of it is just getting in time with each other  working as one  and it takes like the whole year to build up this.,0.5647,0.112,0.888,0.0,p65
So him deciding to [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
was really going to be massively detrimental  'cause you can get someone to sub in and fill his seat but it's not the same.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Um  so  convincing him to stay on  as part of the team and kind of rallying like getting a good  like  boat spirit  that we weren't just here guys that kind of rowed  but we all got along well and we actually wanted to row for each other.,0.815,0.214,0.786,0.0,p65
And because I had been given responsibility as Boat Captain  no like the overall boat club captain  but that boat.,-0.1419,0.0,0.924,0.076,p65
So  um  doing things like havin'  um  pre-race meetings together  and watching  like  video clips before  like kind of motivation Rocky style stuff.,0.836,0.343,0.657,0.0,p65
Um  and just making sure like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between  yeah we need to train at this level to be good  but we don't need to go absolutely overboard  and we can gauge when people just need time off  or need time to unwind or de-stress.,0.9253,0.21,0.773,0.017,p65
Um  so kind of implementing that and it came round to the actual Bumps races  he hadn't quit and um  we managed to do a lot better than the previous term  previous term being a bit of a disaster  then this term we actually the best boat from the college.,0.4588,0.122,0.808,0.07,p65
So that was pretty satisfying.,0.7553,0.683,0.317,0.0,p65
Um  like  again it just kind of shows  like  the races are painful and tough but you work together to get through them  you feel good after.,0.631,0.226,0.676,0.098,p65
So that was like a pretty obvious sporting example of teamwork.,0.7152,0.399,0.601,0.0,p65
So  tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them.,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p65
Um  I think overall I'm quite  like  confident and happy to talk to people and stuff  but maybe a weakness could be that sometimes I do dive into things a little too eagerly  like  um  it could almost be that I could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the  that extra confidence to just sit there quietly for 20-30 seconds  think what the question actually specifically asked and answer it  rather than thinking  okay  they've stopped talking  I better start  and just diving in with an answer.,0.9649,0.249,0.697,0.053,p65
And I'm coming across then as  perhaps  a bit frantic or not completely focused.,-0.6487,0.0,0.694,0.306,p65
So I think some of that is just going to be practice   like do interviews  get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while I compose my thoughts and going into a well structured answer rather than just diving straight in with an answer as I've kind of been doing  I think  so far.,0.8442,0.179,0.821,0.0,p65
[laugh] Um  Actually you've done surprisingly good so far.,0.8271,0.592,0.408,0.0,p65
Uh  so now think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p65
So why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Um  I think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job  but  like  almost any job  um  in today's world isn't going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector.,0.6428,0.13,0.87,0.0,p65
It's going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and I think that  like  I've used my university time so far in the UK and in America  really broadening the experience that I've got.,0.3612,0.067,0.933,0.0,p65
Uh  broadening my  uh  ex- exposure to different fields of engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
And also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even  like  artsy stuff.,0.688,0.23,0.77,0.0,p65
Um  I also think that through like projects  lab work  and things of that nature  I have the skills to work in a team.,0.3612,0.098,0.902,0.0,p65
Be that  having the  uh  kind of humility to accept  okay  there's someone more experiences  more knowledgeable than me in this  I'll take the lead from them or I'll start realizing when it's an appropriate time I'll take the lead here because no one else is really going to  or I'm the best qualified to really take command.,0.7579,0.134,0.832,0.034,p65
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
So  like  in terms of working with others  that's a strength that I have  um  and I think in terms of contributing to like  the overall atmosphere in the company  I'm quite a pleasant  optimistic person.,0.9278,0.321,0.679,0.0,p65
I like to think that I'm someone that others would be happy to work around  so not only would I be working well  but others would be working well  um  through my being there.,0.743,0.217,0.783,0.0,p65
Um  I'm not saying like I'm going to suddenly make the company  like  200% more profitable  but I do think that I'll feedback in as much benefit as I'll get out of a job that I genuinely enjoy.,0.8908,0.26,0.707,0.033,p65
Well thanks for coming today.,0.6124,0.625,0.375,0.0,p65
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p65
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p65
So how are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
I'm doing pretty good Oh good.,0.8402,0.75,0.25,0.0,p66
How about you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
I'm pretty well.,0.6486,0.841,0.159,0.0,p66
Yeah  it's kinda shitty outside haha.,0.1604,0.439,0.267,0.294,p66
Well  I brought an umbrella so it's not too bad  Gotcha.,0.6059,0.355,0.645,0.0,p66
Yeah I thought it was going to snow but I'll take like drizzle over that.,0.5927,0.272,0.728,0.0,p66
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p66
So uhm... Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uhm.. So I'm a junior obviously here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
I'm studying chemical  biological engineering and minoring in economics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uhm  I live in Cap Sigma which is one of the fraternities on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
I'm from Chicago.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uhm  actually I was just home recently for Thanksgiving.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uhm  and then  here on campus I obviously go to class and when I'm not in class I do the like getting involved in my fraternity as well as  uhm  I try to help with Habitat for Humanity so I do a lot with them and some community service stuff that we have as well.,0.8126,0.156,0.844,0.0,p66
Oh cool.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p66
I'm from Chicago too.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Oh cool.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p66
Where?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uh  Wilmeka.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Okay  I'm from Siokee.,0.2263,0.388,0.612,0.0,p66
Oh cool.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p66
So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uhm  so  if I had to give I guess an example of leadership..uhm.. recently this semester I'd probably talk about uhm working with Habitat for Humanity like I mentioned before  uhm  I'm currently the president of the club and uhm so we do a couple of different things on campus here  both on and off campus  uhm  related to like international organization and so one of the big things we do on campus is we  uhm  have what we call the Beaverdash.,0.6124,0.059,0.941,0.0,p66
And its a 5k run around the West end of campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uh huh  And we've done it about 5 of them now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
So this year has since I was in charge of the club I had to organize it  uhm  and it was kind of a unique situation because uhm...  Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
We were working with the President's office.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uh combining with President Griphes inauguration night.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Actually they contacted me  Oh wow.,0.5859,0.432,0.568,0.0,p66
Uh  which was awesome because  like  they have a ton of money *laughs* And resources that I normally wouldn't have.,0.8689,0.366,0.634,0.0,p66
So I uh was able to work with that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
but I think it was a very interesting leadership posi- uh  position because I was networking with my own execs which is 10 of my own students that I work with.,0.611,0.117,0.883,0.0,p66
As well as the greater club which is about 100 kids that actively participate.,0.7096,0.385,0.615,0.0,p66
But then also in conjunction with the President's office which is a couple people in uh staff  uhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
With like  uh  the Z center and things like that.,0.6124,0.385,0.615,0.0,p66
So we were all working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
So it definitely took like going to meetings with like staff and more important people in the world of MIT.,0.8431,0.386,0.614,0.0,p66
And like relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done.,0.6124,0.278,0.722,0.0,p66
And selling tickets and actually running the event and coordinating the volunteers and things like that.,0.3612,0.143,0.857,0.0,p66
So I think it was a really good leadership opportunity and I worked with a lot of interesting people.,0.8384,0.359,0.641,0.0,p66
Ah excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p66
So tell me about a time you were working on a team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
You faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.302,0.698,0.0,p66
How did you go about solving it?,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,p66
Uhm  lets think of a good challenge.,0.4939,0.457,0.543,0.0,p66
Uhm.. Okay so  uhm  more recently  I was working on well I'm involved with my fraternity.,0.4588,0.222,0.778,0.0,p66
One of my objectives was to plan a little retreated that we have  like going camping.,0.3612,0.143,0.857,0.0,p66
Uh huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
So as part of that I work with a team of people  some of them are freshmen which is who the retreat is meant for.,0.2023,0.07,0.93,0.0,p66
Some of the are my friend  well everyone's my friend  but so its like an interesting dynamic because you're working with your friends but you have to kinda be managing them and stuff like that.,0.9711,0.468,0.532,0.0,p66
So that was like challenge number one.,0.5209,0.573,0.427,0.0,p66
But then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we had 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere.,0.5719,0.198,0.802,0.0,p66
The real challenge we had was getting people to commit and to count accurate numbers and stuff like that.,0.6124,0.273,0.727,0.0,p66
So I was really able to like in the context of the team organize people to go and personally talk to like all 60 people.,0.6444,0.186,0.814,0.0,p66
So we could get a feel for like who was actually coming.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p66
Because an issue we had in the past 50 people would say they wanted to come but only 40 people would show up.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars wasting.,-0.0516,0.189,0.606,0.205,p66
and so its really important to get an accurate count and finding out who has dietary restrictions who had certain.,0.5356,0.198,0.802,0.0,p66
Traditionally it is really nice to use like email to talk to people but here we've been really utilizing  uhm  actually going in person and having meetings together and breaking out and talking to individuals  and then  like  doing allocation of like  who  was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food purchase or stuff like that.,0.9108,0.192,0.808,0.0,p66
Uhm so there's a lot of different allocation of  uh  tasks  and then  like individual talking to people and so those kinda overcame those different challenges.,0.4215,0.137,0.863,0.0,p66
Ah excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p66
So  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it.,0.34,0.221,0.632,0.147,p66
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p66
So  uhm  my greatest weakness currently  uhm  the best way I guess to phrase it would be Uh huh.,0.7823,0.315,0.583,0.102,p66
I guess I feel like I need to be very involved in things I do whether they be like if I'm doing a project or leading an activity I feel like I need to be very on top of whats going on - which is of course a good thing you obviously if your in charge of something you want to be aware of whats happening.,0.8952,0.187,0.813,0.0,p66
But I think its my weakness because it allows me to not allocate enough to other people and it cop me to stress myself out and possibly not have as good as a final project because I've taken too much on for myself.,-0.8887,0.0,0.792,0.208,p66
So that's obviously a kind of weakness and uhm what I've kinda been currently doing to counter it.. is uhm  really working on finding like friends to kinda like overview what I'm doing especially if I'm involved in.,0.5739,0.174,0.757,0.069,p66
Very specifically delligating stuff to them and working on kinda like not doing as much and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and let someone work without checking in to really promote like letting them to go do their own thing and not concern myself with it obviously responsibly but also at the same time to not over burden myself.,0.8125,0.15,0.85,0.0,p66
Hm  oh that makes a lot of sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
So  I'd like you to think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.6461,0.305,0.695,0.0,p66
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p66
Got it?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
Uhhhmmm  sure.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p66
Okay  so  why do you think we should hire you for this job?,0.2263,0.137,0.863,0.0,p66
Uhm  so I think I bring a lot to the table by having been here for 2 and a half years here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
I've gained a lot of technical skills  of course  I've taken a lot of classes and done a lot of laboratory research.,0.3818,0.11,0.89,0.0,p66
I've done a lot of projects through those classes.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p66
And so I think I have a lot of technical skills and  uhm  I  in this position at this company would really have the ability to take these skills and combine them and applying them with the other skills I've picked up here which are leadership and communication skills.,0.3744,0.051,0.949,0.0,p66
Uhm  cause right now they've kinda been in separate realms where I do a lot of activities on campus where I've had the opportunity to plan events and I've kinda been able to take those skills and apply them towards like a technical related problem on which I would be able to do at this company and hone both of those together which I think would be very advantageous for me and very advantageous for you as a company  Uhm  and really allow me to show off the abilities I've learned here.,0.8854,0.147,0.827,0.026,p66
Ah  well  thank you for coming.,0.5574,0.535,0.465,0.0,p66
Yeah  of course.,0.296,0.524,0.476,0.0,p66
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I’m actually doing pretty well.,0.6486,0.639,0.361,0.0,p67
I’m just  uh  I would say  well  let’s see.,0.2732,0.208,0.792,0.0,p67
It’s the end of the semester  right after Thanksgiving break.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
So  I have a bunch of time to relax and that sort of thing.,0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,p67
This is the first time I didn’t get home though.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Really?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Um  so I spent a bunch of time actually with my friends from my fraternity.,0.4767,0.181,0.819,0.0,p67
And  we had Thanksgiving dinner together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
The turkey  the whole shebang.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Um  most people around this time have all sort of exams  that sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
But  all things considered compared to like freshman  sophomore  junior year  um I’m actually taking an extra semester to technically still a junior.,0.5023,0.129,0.871,0.0,p67
Oh  ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Um  it’s pretty relaxed.,0.7506,0.762,0.238,0.0,p67
Things are good.,0.4404,0.592,0.408,0.0,p67
Ok  please tell me about yourself.,0.5423,0.529,0.471,0.0,p67
Well  to start  um  I guess to start.,0.2732,0.231,0.769,0.0,p67
The three things I’m doing right now: I’m president of my fraternity  SAE  which I also helped start up.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Oh  yeah?,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p67
It’s just one of the new fraternities that just you know came out of nowhere.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
We were back on campus awhile ago  but that’s history  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I’m a late grower  and I’m also a chemical engineer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Most people have to say Course 10 for their major that sort of thing  uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
And  I’m part of the growing engineer leadership program.,0.1779,0.175,0.825,0.0,p67
So  uh  all things considered  I would say that the the things that I’ve come to learn the most since coming to MIT are leadership skills  being confident  being able to go in front of people  and  uh  sort of create a vision.,0.719,0.149,0.851,0.0,p67
Helping people follow that vision.,0.4939,0.583,0.417,0.0,p67
I have had issues in the past of time management.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
But  I spent a long time doing  like freshman  sophomore year learning the importance of sleep.,0.7579,0.317,0.683,0.0,p67
Bunch of things like that.,0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,p67
I’ve gone through the whole  all the trials and tribulations.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
But  all things considered  I’d say pretty much right now  I’m smooth  like in a groove  doing my own kind of thing.,0.8201,0.274,0.726,0.0,p67
Things that I want to do.,0.0772,0.206,0.794,0.0,p67
And  having a good time.,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p67
So  um  back to leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Tell me a time when you acted as a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Well  just like this whole semester.,0.5574,0.535,0.465,0.0,p67
Um  since I’ve been like the president of my fraternity there have been situations with people who are called brothers.,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,p67
Where  they  for some reason  they have these issues that they can’t talk about.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I’m the kind of person that I can tell when someone is having.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I sort of like pry  not pry  but press a little bit until they either like to decided to like tell me more or tell me what’s going on.,0.7966,0.238,0.762,0.0,p67
There was one case  in the sense that mattered  but there was a person that  um  that became a pledge of our fraternity  he came from the previous president.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
It’s called rush (talking over each other).,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Basically  what happened is this guy came in  and very few people knew him when he came in  but once they got to know him over the summer they didn’t like him at all.,0.5023,0.09,0.91,0.0,p67
So  I had to deal with the situation of trying to find out what to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Like  do we let him stay?,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,p67
Or let him go through the program and see if he improves?,0.4215,0.203,0.797,0.0,p67
Or do we sort of like nip it in the bud right there?,0.2975,0.155,0.845,0.0,p67
Uh  it brought  first off  I didn’t even want to bring that information up until I’d talked to a bunch of people.,0.0772,0.058,0.942,0.0,p67
So  I talked to a bunch of people individually  got a feel for it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Then  I sort of predicted how the conversation was going to go.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Ultimately  what ended up happening  was uh  We had to find a really nice way of letting the guy go.,0.4754,0.14,0.86,0.0,p67
It was sort of touchy feely sensitive stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I really had to let  to make sure I talked to everyone before that happened.,0.3182,0.141,0.859,0.0,p67
That’s an excellent example of leadership.,0.5719,0.425,0.575,0.0,p67
So  this is a similar question  but related.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p67
Not this time  a different one.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Course 10.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Chemical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
ICE.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
You are given a challenge in a team.,0.0772,0.157,0.843,0.0,p67
Most people  you can actually choose your team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Most people throughout there are  there fun people  good at working with (inaudible) that sort of thing.,0.7351,0.292,0.708,0.0,p67
Uh  but by the time I went to choose my team most of my friends had been swooped up.,0.6752,0.202,0.798,0.0,p67
So  I was working with kind of a random group of people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Which kind of worked out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
It turned out pretty well.,0.6486,0.639,0.361,0.0,p67
The project itself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
You have to design a chemical engineering plant.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
So  you have to do the reactors  you have to do the flow  the mass flow  the distribution com center  etc.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
And then there’s a big report.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
There’s all sorts of stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
In general breakdown  there’s one person who sort of becomes like the expert for the program  the Aspen program.,0.2975,0.109,0.891,0.0,p67
And  then there’s another person whose more like working on the actual write up  and then there’s another person that sort of integrates the two.,0.4201,0.104,0.896,0.0,p67
What  what as the question?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Working in a team?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Faced a challenge  how did you solve it?,0.2732,0.341,0.659,0.0,p67
Ok  um  I guess the biggest issue that came up in that project was the deadline.,0.296,0.128,0.872,0.0,p67
Two and three days before the actual deadline  the final project was due  the main issue came up  the kiln wasn’t working  the project wasn’t working.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
So  it’s a pretty typical MIT scenario.,0.5367,0.366,0.634,0.0,p67
The main thing that was the issue was that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy.,0.3182,0.095,0.905,0.0,p67
So  he was like the silent coder that was off doing his own work  when you’re trying to integrate it into the rest of the project  um  we should have collaborating a lot  but this other guy was sort of off in his own world.,0.222,0.041,0.959,0.0,p67
So  when we needed his part of the project  it was sort of difficult to do.,-0.4201,0.0,0.843,0.157,p67
So  what we had to do was we had to sit down all three of us together and go play by play with this guy to sort of get the medium that they left.,0.5859,0.13,0.87,0.0,p67
To  sort of get the project together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Um  and I would say the hardest part was just interacting with this man because he was very quiet.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
He did get a lot of quality work done  but looking back  what I would have tried to do better was noticed he was a quieter person  and really tried to get him to be more  uh  evocative.,0.5927,0.094,0.906,0.0,p67
You know  sharing the thoughts and stuff that he was doing during like the feed.,0.6486,0.29,0.71,0.0,p67
The project we ended up delivering on time up to spec  but it would have been better if we had started with the issue at the beginning.,0.5927,0.129,0.871,0.0,p67
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p67
That makes a lot of sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
So  tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you’ve done to overcome them.,0.4019,0.203,0.676,0.121,p67
At the end of every single  like group that I’m with  everyone gets to the sort of critique phase where they see what they’ve done well and what they haven’t done as well.,0.6908,0.183,0.817,0.0,p67
I can sort of like come of as being a little bit  well  gregarious is one thing.,0.464,0.212,0.788,0.0,p67
Um  but also sometimes I can sort of dominate a conversation.,-0.2936,0.0,0.82,0.18,p67
Um  so that’s one thing I learned from the Growing Engineer leadership program.,0.1779,0.124,0.876,0.0,p67
And  the identify each of your skills  and find out that you’re bad at it.,-0.5423,0.0,0.8,0.2,p67
And  the thing that I’m really trying to work on is not dominating the conversation.,0.2235,0.119,0.881,0.0,p67
I’ve been working on it over the years.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
And  the main ways I try to do that  is first off  don’t be the guy who always takes the leadership role right from the get go.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
What I do is instead if there's a little bit of  if some one is having a hard time  I’ll start giving suggestions.,0.25,0.097,0.847,0.056,p67
And then people can start jumping on to those suggestions.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
And  if I notice there is a person who is really good at  like engaged  who really wants to take this forward.,0.8251,0.313,0.687,0.0,p67
I’ll find a way to make it so they become the leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
And  so instead of me directing everyone and sort of imposing  I really ask for everyones input.,-0.1761,0.0,0.904,0.096,p67
And make it so everyone feels involved.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
So  this is more of not a one example  but a change that’s in progress.,0.5719,0.209,0.791,0.0,p67
I think  how I was at the beginning  just sort of loud mouth asking a lot of questions  like sort of this is how we are going to do everything.,0.3612,0.079,0.921,0.0,p67
Now  it’s like I volley around ideas and try to get other peoples input instead.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,p67
That makes a lot of sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
So  think about a job you would like to have.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p67
Do you have one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Yeah  I’ve been thinking about that for awhile.,0.296,0.239,0.761,0.0,p67
So  tell me why do you think you should have this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Well  the thing about consulting  is that the main reason why it’s intriguing me right now is because it’s the kind of job where everything is fast paced.,0.2732,0.072,0.928,0.0,p67
But  two it’s the critical factor is teamwork.,-0.4497,0.0,0.704,0.296,p67
Working with other people who are a variety of ages.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Being able to extract information and essentially be able to do a project that has a very short timeline.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
It has a timeline  it has a scope  got a budget.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Being able to do find different resources  make connections  and building relationships with new people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Which I think is one of the most important things  building relationships with people is critical.,-0.0534,0.114,0.761,0.125,p67
And then being able to sort of patent those new projects while also being  find out  or getting a breadth  or a feel for so many different fields.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I thought about semi-conductors and decide to not do semi-conductors because of the class I’m taking right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
I think team work is the most critical part of the matter.,-0.3597,0.08,0.73,0.189,p67
I think your personality matches that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p67
Well  this concludes the formal part of the interview.,0.2732,0.208,0.792,0.0,p67
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Uh  so I'm uh  I guess I was born in DC.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
I lived in Maryland until I was seven.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Then my parents decided it would be a good idea to move to Nigeria which is where we're from.,0.4404,0.139,0.861,0.0,p69
And I lived the next seven years of my life there and I came back to America for Junior and Senior year of college  of high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Once I did that  um  in Sag (?).,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
But like during that period I sort of I found an interest in kind of engineering so I decided to apply at MIT  you know it's the best engineering school.,0.9331,0.326,0.674,0.0,p69
And I uh  I got accepted there.,0.2732,0.259,0.741,0.0,p69
And I'm here right now in Junior year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Uh  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p69
That's all.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
So can you tell me about a time when you acted as a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Acted as a leader  um  well  in my  one of my classes I was taking this semester  it's  uh  212  Intro to Robotics  and it was  uh  like  the lab portion of the class is a group project and so there are four people and there has to be a team leader to get everyone organized and get everyone on the same page.,0.5574,0.07,0.93,0.0,p69
Everyone know what's going on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Um  and I sort of volunteered myself uh  as a leader and it's been  it's actually been much harder than I thought.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Working with different people who want do to different things I guess for this project and so just organizing everyone and sort of focusing everyone has been an interesting challenge.,0.5106,0.164,0.836,0.0,p69
Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p69
So  perhaps  the challenge you're talking about.,0.144,0.207,0.793,0.0,p69
How did you go about resolving it?,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,p69
Uh  uh  uh  I guess for my another class Im taking this semester which is Design and Manufacturing there's a group of eight people and we're tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred helios (sp)  um  yeah  and so  I guess the  the  the prerequisite to the class was  uh  Design and Manufacturing 1 where we had to make one robot.,0.296,0.035,0.965,0.0,p69
And sort of  that was more individual  but here we're tasked with the  the big thing here is manufacturing and so I  it's easy for everyone to want to decide to design this helio but you have to consider the manufacturing aspect  like how easy would it be to make if you're making a ton of them.,0.9152,0.194,0.806,0.0,p69
And so this was a challenge getting everyone to agree on sort of one design idea and I sort of  I brought up  I made it  I made sure to let everyone know it wasn't just the design that we're worrying about  it's also  and more so  the manufacturing aspects.,0.4019,0.112,0.844,0.044,p69
Interesting.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p69
So  can you tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to sort of improve on that.,0.6494,0.249,0.659,0.092,p69
Uh  so I'm not  I say I like public speaking but I'm not very good at it.,-0.3988,0.087,0.743,0.17,p69
I say that's one of my greatest weaknesses  um  and sort of working on it hasn't been hard just because it's something I like doing.,0.6701,0.254,0.667,0.079,p69
Um  and so  like  given opportunities I try to be the leader of a certain group.,0.8023,0.387,0.613,0.0,p69
That way I talk to  I'm talking to the whole group a lot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
That sort of helps my speaking.,0.3197,0.316,0.684,0.0,p69
And just like in class projects  particularly humanities  I try to focus on taking ones where there's public speaking involved  not just writing essays.,0.3612,0.098,0.902,0.0,p69
Well cool.,0.5267,1.0,0.0,0.0,p69
A lot of fun courses here.,0.5106,0.398,0.602,0.0,p69
So then I'd like you to think of a job you'd like to have.,0.6444,0.305,0.695,0.0,p69
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p69
Do you have one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Yeah  sure.,0.5423,1.0,0.0,0.0,p69
Good  okay.,0.5859,1.0,0.0,0.0,p69
So now  why do you think you should have this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Uh  because I am as I'm a junior at MIT and um  this is a good place to find sort of the best engineers  some of the best engineers in the world and student  sort of  interns and I'd do  I'd do a great job interning at this company sort of because of the experience I have previously and the knowledge  combine that with the knowledge I'm getting here at a world class institute.,0.9442,0.178,0.822,0.0,p69
I think that'd make me well-qualified.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
Ah.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p69
So hi  I'm Dr.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
Powell.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
Hi  I'm Jacob.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
Pleased to meet you.,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,p7
So  how are you doing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p7
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
I'm well  thank you.,0.5574,0.697,0.303,0.0,p7
So  uh  please tell me about yourself.,0.3774,0.301,0.699,0.0,p7
I'm a junior at MIT studying math and science and Im looking for a summer internship at your company this summer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
So  I'm actually currently president of two student groups on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
The Educational studies program  which runs uh  large scale educational programs for middle and high school students where they take classes taught by MIT students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
And the MIT Mystery Hunt   which is a one weekend event in January with thousands of MIT students and other community members come to participate in a large multi-day sort of puzzle competition.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
I'd be happy to go into detail about either of those but I have plenty of stories to tell Tell me about a time when you were working in a team and you faced a challenge.,0.4215,0.101,0.899,0.0,p7
How did you solve the problem.,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p7
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p7
So one thing that comes to mind is a couple months ago I was in a robotics competition at MIT called Mass Lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
So  it's an autonomous robotics competition where you have to design  build  program the robot from scratch.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
And I was in charge of programming the robot for the team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
We ran into several problems with the vision libraries we were trying to use in order to try to track the balls and field elements  just weren't working for us.,-0.1779,0.061,0.856,0.083,p7
We spent probably the first half of the month trying to get these to work for the team and  um  eventually just decided that it would be easier for us to start from scratch and  uh  write everything ourselves.,0.4215,0.069,0.931,0.0,p7
Sort of by  you know  throwing out the assumption that we should work with the code we were given and starting from (?),0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
principles we were able to actually  um  get our vision to  be at a level above most of the other teams because we could sort of custom write the code to be specific to the task at hand rather than trying to adapt general libraries.,0.6369,0.108,0.892,0.0,p7
Tell me one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,p7
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p7
Um  I guess one of the weaknesses I've found is that I tend not to know when to ask for help.,0.0516,0.112,0.785,0.103,p7
So  for instance at my internship last summer this is something that my mentor pointed out to me several times.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
If I got stuck on a problem I would just see what I could do about it  you know  Google around for the solution  see if anyone else had encountered the problem and then only after a couple of days of trying to work around it then talk to someone.,-0.6249,0.041,0.826,0.133,p7
Whereas  you know  if I just asked someone for help the first day they could say  Oh  I ran into this problem last month.,-0.1091,0.097,0.791,0.112,p7
This is how you fix it and avoid me sort of this hassle of trying to Google and figure it out on my own.,-0.296,0.0,0.913,0.087,p7
So  I um  I definitely started to become more aware of this over the summer and made a conscious effort to  when I was having a problem  you know  look at my watch and figure out how much time I was wasting trying to solve it.,-0.2263,0.087,0.809,0.104,p7
If it got to me more than half an hour on my own I would just poke someone next to me and ask them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
I think just sort of continuing that and trying to make sure that I'm keeping up the habit of ensuring that I'm not getting stuck on my own should help.,0.7808,0.254,0.746,0.0,p7
And now  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p7
That's an interesting question.,0.4019,0.474,0.526,0.0,p7
Um  I think  I think so a lot of the candidates you've seen probably  um  come in with similar abilities.,0.25,0.095,0.905,0.0,p7
You know  students at schools like MIT tend to be very top  at the top of their class.,0.659,0.299,0.701,0.0,p7
Um  so  I wouldn't say there's much that differentiates me there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
But I would say that I think I would get along well with your company.,0.3919,0.159,0.841,0.0,p7
Um  I  people who have worked with me before have told me that I'm just sort of a fun person to be on a team with.,0.4601,0.107,0.893,0.0,p7
Um  so  if you sort of look out to other aspects beyond just the numbers or GPA  or what's on my resume  you know  try to maybe you know  if you want me to hang around at  have  hang out at the office for a couple of days and  you know  work with you guys  we can see how that goes I'm confident that uh  you'd think I  you would conclude that I would be a good fit here.,0.836,0.117,0.883,0.0,p7
Well thank you for coming.,0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,p7
Any other questions?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p7
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
I'm good  how about you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p70
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p70
So  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
Uh  so I'm a junior majoring in biology at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
Um  I'm interested in approaching graduate school in biological oceanography.,0.4019,0.231,0.769,0.0,p70
Um  I'm also doing a minor in chemistry.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
I currently work in the Thompson Lab here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
r: Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p70
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
Um  I would say  so uh I'm the vice president of Campus Outreach here at MIT's teenage beauty.,0.7096,0.269,0.731,0.0,p70
Um  yeah so we're in charge of generally reaching out to the student population here at MIT.,0.4588,0.211,0.789,0.0,p70
Um  so what I've done is basically try and form partnerships with maybe clinics in the Boston area  like Fenway Health and try to get them to maybe set up screenings here at MIT.,0.3612,0.07,0.93,0.0,p70
Okay  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.296,0.186,0.814,0.0,p70
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p70
Um  I would say probably in my previous lab  this past summer I worked in Israel and we were having a lot of trouble with just  um  figuring out a protocol for how to um culture the bacteria that we were trying to do.,-0.4019,0.0,0.941,0.059,p70
So  it was generally  just like getting input from everybody and um trying not to get heated because we were kind of like  pressed for results.,0.5729,0.164,0.836,0.0,p70
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p70
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p70
Uh  I would say one weakness is probably that I don't  um  speak up very much  or I would prefer not to speak up maybe  so that probably maybe leaves opportunities or maybe give less input than I would in certain situations.,0.2263,0.101,0.839,0.06,p70
So um  what I'm doing to overcome that is probably more of  maybe not concrete things really  but hopefully just trying to get more experience so that I can maybe feel more confident about myself.,0.866,0.209,0.791,0.0,p70
And why do you think you should get into graduate school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
I think because I really have a passion for this field.,0.5046,0.246,0.754,0.0,p70
I cannot imagine myself doing anything other than research.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p70
It is definitely what I want to do for the rest of my life and I think I would be a good candidate for academia.,0.7096,0.239,0.761,0.0,p70
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p71
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Uh  I'm an MIT undergraduate junior studying mechanical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
And  I'm doing the flexible course which allows me to concentrate  um  in an area other than mechanical engineering.,0.2263,0.095,0.905,0.0,p71
I chose building technology and I'm hoping to get a double minor in energy and architecture as well.,0.7184,0.318,0.682,0.0,p71
You're busy.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
I'm sorry?,-0.0772,0.0,0.435,0.565,p71
You're busy.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p71
Uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Um  I have taken on several leadership roles in my sorority.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Um  one of the most recent roles was a CPW chair so  um  our university  uh  holds a weekend  uh  to invite prospective students who have been accepted but have not decided to come to MIT yet.,0.2144,0.075,0.925,0.0,p71
M'hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
And it's an important time to show them how great MIT is but also to give them a taste of different activities on campus.,0.4497,0.152,0.848,0.0,p71
Um  so I organized a dinner at our house with a co-chair and then this year I'm planning all of our outer-social events.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
So there are basically three large  um  formal events... Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p71
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p71
So in high school I was really involved on the robotics team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Um  there  I had  three other teammates.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
And it was very difficult to narrow down ideas  everyone had  like  different views  different opinions about how we should do things.,-0.0754,0.099,0.791,0.11,p71
Um  and I think that communication was the most important thing  making sure that like that we were putting our ideas on the table but also listening to each other.,0.4491,0.155,0.845,0.0,p71
M'hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
I thought that was one of the most important  um  factors in our success.,0.6997,0.326,0.674,0.0,p71
We ended up doing pretty well as a group.,0.6486,0.431,0.569,0.0,p71
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,p71
Yeah... Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?,-0.0772,0.112,0.761,0.127,p71
One of my weaknesses is  kind of  um  going out of my comfort zone as far as what I'm studying.,0.0,0.109,0.783,0.109,p71
So I think that  uh  in high school because I was so involved in robotics I didn't really look outside of mechanical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
And then my parents are also architects  which is where that came from.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
So  there are two things that I'm really passionate about  but I feel that  especially being at MIT there are so many other areas I am kind of neglecting.,-0.3905,0.07,0.81,0.12,p71
Particularly the arts  I just don't really feel  um  I feel its important to have a bounds and not really achieving that right now.,0.2023,0.073,0.927,0.0,p71
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p71
Um  I believe that I have a very strong educational background in the field.,0.5563,0.217,0.783,0.0,p71
Um  I  I'm really passionate about the subject.,0.5709,0.345,0.655,0.0,p71
It's something that I've been exposed to in the past because my parents are architects.,-0.0772,0.0,0.915,0.085,p71
Um  but  at the same time  I think it's something that I think is very important for the future  um  in terms of like energy consumption.,0.8196,0.271,0.729,0.0,p71
Um  I wasn't sur... I knew I wanted to go into some sort of like energy field at MIT and I think I finally found one that I really enjoy.,0.7584,0.218,0.782,0.0,p71
(Laughs) Good!,0.75,1.0,0.0,0.0,p71
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
Uh  good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p72
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,p72
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
Um  uh  so I'm Rebecca.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
I'm a junior  uh  studying linguistics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
Um  and I think I'm interested in doing linguistic research after undergrad.,0.4019,0.197,0.803,0.0,p72
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p72
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
Um  let's see  uh  so I did a  um  RA  I was an RA in my dorm  and we were in charge of leading the group of freshman  um  in advising them for academic reasons and  also in doing that- organizing events around the dorm  so I would occasionally be in the  uh  in the leadership position for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p72
And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p72
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p72
Um  let's see  uh  for a linguistics project we had to do  I was working on  um  a team  or a group project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
And- Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
And  uh  there was a problem.,-0.4019,0.0,0.649,0.351,p72
One of the members  uh  wasn't contributing their work on time  and so  we had to resolve that.,0.3818,0.133,0.867,0.0,p72
So  um  we- the members who had been working together  uh  got together and we decided that call that person in and  just sort of discussed it with them and said that it was holding everyone back.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
And  uh  we were able to resolve it.,0.3818,0.271,0.729,0.0,p72
'kay  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,p72
Uh  one of my weaknesses would probably be shyness.,-0.5859,0.0,0.593,0.407,p72
Um  or fear of like talking in front of people  I guess.,-0.1779,0.159,0.637,0.204,p72
Um  but- so I've been doing more projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
A lot of times in linguistics we have to give presentations so  um  I've been doing more of that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
And I actually  uh  volunteered to teach a splash class this fall  so that involves getting up in front of a lot of people and teaching something.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
And that was actually really fun  so I feel like doing things- that was sort of a way or- and I enjoyed what I was teaching about  so it seemed less intimidating.,0.7935,0.24,0.695,0.065,p72
And I hope that doing things like that will get me over my fear of talking to people  so.,0.296,0.22,0.65,0.13,p72
Great  and why do you think we should hire you?,0.6249,0.313,0.687,0.0,p72
Um  I think I have  uh  pretty strong credentials and  uh  doing well in my classes  and  um.,0.8225,0.364,0.636,0.0,p72
I really enjoy research and linguistics.,0.5413,0.411,0.589,0.0,p72
And I think I would  um  I think I work well with others and would be able to take on leadership roles if necessary.,0.2732,0.084,0.916,0.0,p72
And  um  I think I would just have a lot to offer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p72
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p72
Here you go.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p73
Good  tell me about yourself.,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p73
I'm Amanda  I'm a freshman at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
Mmhmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
I'm currently looking into too courses six and eighteen.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
Mmmhmmm So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
Computer Science and Math.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
And I play cello in the orchestra and I'm a part of Sigma Kappa.,0.34,0.156,0.844,0.0,p73
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
Yeah one time in High School I was the President of our youth board for United Way which is a non profit that raises money and awareness for social and economic problems.,0.6369,0.205,0.725,0.07,p73
And then we build and try to change them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
And so my senior year as part of the youth board we ended up fundraising and starting a new fundraiser.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
And it was hockey game between our hockey team and a private schools hockey team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
Which wasn't really a fair game  but that's okay.,0.194,0.215,0.64,0.145,p73
mmmmmmm And it was very down to the wire which we weren't aware of.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
I mean planning an event around winter break is never really easy schedule wise and stuff.,0.1879,0.168,0.7,0.131,p73
But it was definitely a challenge for us  but it was  it ended up being successful and we raised over $4000 for us.,0.8807,0.338,0.662,0.0,p73
oh Yea.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
The organization is definitely one of my favorite  um  it let's students  um  like have a way to give back to the community which was a big deal for us since actually that year we lost three kids to suicides via train in a few months.,0.7096,0.156,0.8,0.044,p73
And so it was really nice for us to have a way to like actually give back to our community instead of just thinking about it and wishing we could do something so  it worked out really nicely for us to like really make a difference.,0.9039,0.243,0.757,0.0,p73
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
So tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p73
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p73
I mean in school we get a lot of projects that are group projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
mmhmm And I have noticed that a tend to be a person who when the slack doesn't  you know the slack starts to happen  is kind of do it  and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone and so I remember senior year we just had this project  um  in Math.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
And it was just so frustrating to do it by myself  and so I set every one and I was like I can't do this on my own anymore  and I really need your help.,0.1834,0.133,0.777,0.091,p73
And it was really nice because they were my friends  and they didn't realize they were doing it.,0.7346,0.279,0.721,0.0,p73
And so we like made up a new plan and re divied the work and it worked out in the end.,0.4173,0.122,0.878,0.0,p73
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p73
And can you tell me a weakness?,-0.4215,0.0,0.682,0.318,p73
One of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.815,0.185,p73
Yea.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
I'm kind of a perfectionist and I like everything to work out well.,0.7269,0.415,0.585,0.0,p73
Which means that when I'm starting something new sometimes I can't look over the little details that I don't see that will work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
And I don't get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goal.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
So that's definitely been one of my problems and I have been working on getting over that.,0.0717,0.144,0.725,0.131,p73
But just thinking about it in the future and just you know you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvy it up into smaller tasks its a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything so.,0.5719,0.079,0.921,0.0,p73
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p73
Baby steps.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
I think you should hire me because I have had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up  like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with.,0.9382,0.327,0.673,0.0,p73
And you know of course not everyone can get their way but it's important to try and get everyone's ideas into one if you can so.,0.296,0.081,0.919,0.0,p73
Mmmmhmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p73
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
Okay  I'm a computer science major  um  I'm a  senior at MIT and I'm hoping to stay in the area next year.,0.5719,0.19,0.81,0.0,p74
I'm looking for a job here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
And I grew up in South Dakota and little bit in Cambodia  grew up on a farm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
I really enjoy playing music and cooking.,0.6779,0.527,0.473,0.0,p74
Probably my two biggest hobbies.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p74
Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
Well  when I was in high school I was the leader of my 4-H club and that involved leading meetings.,0.2732,0.1,0.9,0.0,p74
There were a lot of younger kids were involved and I helped them get involved in sewing competitions for example and  um  things where they could learn about nutrition.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
Um  and showing their animals and learning about how to raise an animal well.,0.2732,0.139,0.861,0.0,p74
So that was a big leadership role and it was kind of difficult but I definitely learned a lot from it.,0.3926,0.145,0.777,0.078,p74
And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p74
How did you solve it?,0.2023,0.31,0.69,0.0,p74
Um  I play music with some of my friends in some social settings.,0.6705,0.333,0.667,0.0,p74
We've played for a couple of weddings and it's sometimes difficult to coordinate what we would like to play and how we'd like to practice and the styles of music that we'd like to play  um  and to do that properly you just need to communicate a lot  um  and you need to be willing to sometimes do the things that you really don't want to do.,0.8657,0.189,0.759,0.051,p74
And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p74
One of my weaknesses is probably procrastination  same as a ton of people  I'm sure.,-0.0516,0.129,0.73,0.14,p74
To overcome that I am trying to structure my time and I have a schedule so that Ill do one thing for an hour and one thing for the next hour so if I procrastinate for the whole hour then I feel bad.,-0.7635,0.0,0.862,0.138,p74
So  the idea is to avoid that.,-0.296,0.0,0.732,0.268,p74
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p74
And why do you think we should hire you.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p74
I think that I am a strong  strong learner  definitely at whatever new skills since in web development there's always new technologies coming along.,0.8519,0.307,0.693,0.0,p74
I am quick at learning those and I really enjoy learning new things.,0.5413,0.225,0.775,0.0,p74
And I have a good base with my computer science degree from MIT so I know in general how to think about programming.,0.4404,0.116,0.884,0.0,p74
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
I'm doing well.,0.2732,0.512,0.488,0.0,p76
Thanks.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Well  I'm Zainab Lasisi Mm-hmm.,0.2732,0.344,0.656,0.0,p76
I'm a junior majoring in chemical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
I was originally born in Nigeria.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Which is in West Africa.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And I grew up in England and Jamaica before coming to MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
A time I demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
I'd probably say  at the moment  um  in my position as the Vice President of the African Students Association at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So as the vice president I have to be bas-  I have to basically support the president.,0.4019,0.144,0.856,0.0,p76
And whenever the president of the association is not there step in.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And actually be the leader for the association.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So the African Student's Association is about an organization of  uhh  that consists of.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
That comprises of about 80 Africans at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And  it's just all undergraduates.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And it's all about just keep the African community alive.,0.3818,0.224,0.776,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And just  so that people know that they have a support system.,0.4019,0.197,0.803,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Within  uh  MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Cause most of them are  like  international students.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So they're very far away from home.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So it's like having a home away from home... Yeah.,0.6096,0.384,0.616,0.0,p76
...for them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
And tell me a time about when you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p76
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p76
I'd probably say my past internship with BP.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Um  I was working on a team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
I was a process engineer intern.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And the challenge I had was that I was given a project that  they didn't really know what.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,p76
They hadn't  the project hadn't been done before.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
It's just something  like  they had ideas about what they wanted.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
But they had no clear cut visions... Okay.,0.4845,0.505,0.292,0.203,p76
...or anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
We just knew the  I guess  the skill set.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And the types of things they want from my project.,0.0772,0.126,0.874,0.0,p76
So for me  just to go about delivering a  a tool that's of use to the entire team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
It is about working with people  communicating  asking them questions... Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
...about what exactly it is they what me to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And then doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Then I did  like  a few modeling things.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,p76
And then I'll show them and then they'll give me feedback  and then I'll do some more.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So that was more about it cause I don't think they had an idea about what they wanted... Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
...in the first place.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
They just knew  okay  we want this model to do this and do that  and do that.,0.296,0.176,0.824,0.0,p76
We're not too sure how it's going to do it  but  you know  just come up with some things.,-0.1232,0.0,0.924,0.076,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
It was all on me to use my creativity and just pick people's brains and just come up with.,0.3818,0.126,0.874,0.0,p76
Deliver something that's of use to the team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p76
I think on of my weaknesses is that  um.,-0.3612,0.0,0.762,0.238,p76
I'd say I'm a very independent worker.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So  sometimes... Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
...I try  like  I don't  I-  I work too much by myself.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p76
Whereas in  I do work well in teams  but I just need to be more forth-.,0.1406,0.094,0.906,0.0,p76
Because when I'm given a project I'm like  okay  I can do this.,0.5267,0.286,0.714,0.0,p76
I'll just try to sort it out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
So  I guess one of my weaknesses is  like  approaching other people... Mm.,0.0,0.156,0.688,0.156,p76
...especially people that I'm not  I don't really know.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And  like  asking them questions and things like that.,0.6124,0.417,0.583,0.0,p76
So  yeah.,0.3597,0.714,0.286,0.0,p76
Something I need to  to develop my communication skills a little better.,0.3832,0.192,0.808,0.0,p76
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
I think that  I am-.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
I have a wonderful personality.,0.5719,0.481,0.519,0.0,p76
I'm great to work with.,0.6249,0.506,0.494,0.0,p76
I will do anything that is asked of me... Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
...with a smile on my face.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,p76
I'll always try my best.,0.6369,0.512,0.488,0.0,p76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
And  I'll be a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p76
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p76
Ready?,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p77
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
I'm goo.. I'm doing well  how are you?,0.2732,0.231,0.769,0.0,p77
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p77
I'm doing well  as well.,0.4939,0.583,0.417,0.0,p77
Please tell me about yourself.,0.3182,0.365,0.635,0.0,p77
Um  so I  my background is in mechanical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
What I really enjoy doing though  um is  leadership type rolls.,0.5413,0.259,0.741,0.0,p77
So I like talking with people but I also like doing technical problems.,0.1504,0.275,0.535,0.19,p77
So I'm looking for a position that really combines those two things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
Uh where I can use my communications skills with people as well as my technical background in a roll that's kinda combin.. involves decision making  uh and different business factors.,0.2732,0.068,0.932,0.0,p77
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p77
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
Uh so  recently umm I'm the leader of our  of a group project that I'm working on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
Basically what we have to do is design a speech system and with the system  uh  as leader of our team I do a lot of organizing delegating tasks  uh different types of conflict management  making sure people are talking  understanding whatever everybody's wanting  uh different type of  just general making sure I'm aware of all the group dynamics that are going on.,0.5267,0.099,0.868,0.034,p77
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p77
Tell me about a time you were working on a team  and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p77
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p77
Okay  uhh so I was on a team  uhh  it was actually just two people  uh but it was to design and build a robot at the end of last semester  and uhh my partner and I have very different working styles  which I didn't expect.,0.1154,0.031,0.969,0.0,p77
I was kinda have projected my own tendencies on him in assuming that if I was going to finish something he would do the same way or work the same way as I  as I was going to.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
Uh but it didn't end up being true and so we ended up at the very end  uh  not having our final product ready  not having everything together and what I ended up doing was just making sure that I used all the resources I had  so friends outside of the project who um were willing to help with what was going on  uh to try to pull something together  made sure I was going to contact my professor and then try to communicate with him as much as possible  uh  to collaborate with what was going on in order to get um like uh somewhat finished final project  ther... that was  our professor said was acceptable and done by the end  about the time we had finished.. wait  the time that we had to finish.,0.9819,0.18,0.82,0.0,p77
Mmm.. okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p77
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p77
Uh I think one of my main weaknesses is  uh  taking on too many little things.,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p77
Umm so sometimes not realizing  uh  what the little things are that I can let go for a little bit  and prioritizing  uh  large period of times of saying yes to too many things.,0.4019,0.076,0.924,0.0,p77
Uh and what I'm mainly trying to do to change that is just keeping track of exactly how I spend my time.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
So recently Ive been really trying to focus in on  how long am I really wasting on little tasks  and how long I'm actually spending on larger tasks  um and I  and seeing that is very helpful  uh  in changing how I prioritize things Great.,0.6369,0.138,0.805,0.057,p77
And why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
I'm very dependable.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
I'm responsible.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,p77
I will get things done when they need to be done.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
Uh and I like to communicate with people  overcome challenges  uh  I have been use to working with people with very diverse backgrounds and I'm not afraid of a challenge.,0.4767,0.159,0.841,0.0,p77
Um  I'm also I'm use to being a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p77
I've worked on lots of team and know people so uhh  I'm also very excited about the vision of the company and whats going on and I think overall uh what I've learned here about the culture would fit me well.,0.807,0.201,0.799,0.0,p77
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p77
Um  tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Um  I'm a junior in computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
What sort of things do you want to know about me?,0.0772,0.115,0.885,0.0,p78
Just Anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
I like programming in python.,0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,p78
I haven't been in computer science that long because I used to be a chemistry major.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
But I've been taking computer science classes for the past year and a half.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Great...so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
I'm the president of my acapella group so I have to organize publicity things like when we have a performance I have to make sure that everyone knows about the performance  so we have an audience.,0.5859,0.124,0.876,0.0,p78
I organize details like the reception and the getting a room reserved.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,p78
OK...Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p78
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p78
Hmm m...a time when I was working with a team...I guess if I could count my acapella group as a team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
cause I guess it is.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Mmhumm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
There are times when we've had conflicts about weather we wanted to sing a specific song  Mmmm For instance often times there would be a song that we really liked but it would take like up a lot of rehearsal time.,0.5418,0.117,0.843,0.04,p78
So we didn't think it was worth it or anything cause we had limited time.,0.0,0.113,0.774,0.113,p78
So we had to resolve the conflict by discussing different options.,0.0772,0.187,0.647,0.165,p78
I think we finally ended up deciding to sing the song in a future semester.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Later we would still be able to sing it but it wouldn't compromise the rest of our repertoire.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
OK can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,0.1111,0.151,0.72,0.129,p78
Hmm m...haha...um mm...can't really think of things that where weaknesses...um mm...laugh.. Its fine.,0.2023,0.13,0.87,0.0,p78
I guess that I have trouble being criticized because I've always been sensitive and  Mmmhmmm.,-0.6369,0.0,0.714,0.286,p78
When I get criticized by people who aren't as sensitive I  I react more strongly to their criticism than they intend me to.,-0.4601,0.086,0.72,0.194,p78
so I have to learn to realize that some people who aren't as sensitive will criticize harsh  more harshly.,-0.6705,0.0,0.756,0.244,p78
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
And why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
Because I'm excited to work at facebook.,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,p78
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
And because I'm motivated to do things in computer science because I find it really fun.,0.7645,0.32,0.68,0.0,p78
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p78
So how are you doing today ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
I'm good  Good .,0.7003,0.744,0.256,0.0,p79
Tell me about yourself .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um I'm from Mumbai .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
I'm a junior in core six .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
When I applied to ITU I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do  Mm Um I thought I would do chemical engineering .,-0.2912,0.0,0.913,0.087,p79
That um that got me super interested in a bunch stuff and um finally decided core six um Mm-hmm But then I visit to the media lab before .,0.5106,0.137,0.863,0.0,p79
Um now I'm working at the over in um  Mm-hmm  So that's and engines I have been involved with engines here and um a bunch of other um clubs like Energy Club  Mm-hmm.,0.5574,0.129,0.871,0.0,p79
and organizing the Energy Conference and and  Oh wow other workshops .,0.7096,0.371,0.629,0.0,p79
So um and in general I'm super interested in um hardware show and um computer science like certain aspects of computer science really interests me too so .,0.9099,0.37,0.63,0.0,p79
Yeah I'm interested you know to learn  Great.,0.8402,0.643,0.357,0.0,p79
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um sure .,0.3182,0.535,0.465,0.0,p79
So well this is the most recent example Mm-hmm I can think of .,0.3384,0.155,0.845,0.0,p79
But I um was a freshman .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
I was I mean I still am pretty excited about international developments Mm-hmm.,0.6808,0.337,0.663,0.0,p79
So I joined um um as it was it was it was .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
It wasn't formally ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
in the USA but we decided to take it on .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
we wanted so we were willing um sort of ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
low cost easy to setup showers we use in Kenya  Mm.,0.2023,0.207,0.643,0.15,p79
Um and it was basically something that I've never done before  Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
computer science people you you know trying ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p79
But their view was .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
it's not .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
So um that was a great thing for me to get involved with .,0.6249,0.24,0.76,0.0,p79
And um that summer I went and traveled with them to Kenya Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um and that was a great experience.,0.6249,0.406,0.594,0.0,p79
So coming back um I was uh elected as  Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
That was um that was a great thing cuz one it's it's important to kind of realize that you might not have all the answers but that's fine .,0.631,0.191,0.809,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
You know you can learn .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
You knew wanna be teens etc.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
But it was like despite not knowing anything about mechanical engineering I was able to sort of understand and learn um sort of graduate to eventually becoming um .,0.5023,0.104,0.896,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
taking on a leadership within that community Great.,0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0,p79
And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p79
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p79
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p79
Um so we had this uh we had this asphalt called which is basically um you do you make them overlap.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And you sort of um pretend as if it's something that you're actually making for industry.,-0.1761,0.0,0.899,0.101,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And um there were four people on the team to program.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Whereas there was me who was kind of like I know how to do it but you know I I could do with more instruction.,0.154,0.063,0.937,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
There was someone who was just starting.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
She wa- she was a freshman that year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um but she was great.,0.7684,0.585,0.415,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And uh we decided to make this app with um when you have two iPhones uh you can swipe like you can bump them and uh whatever's on one phone the other one.,0.3612,0.072,0.928,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
could split them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
It was something that you know we we hadn't done before.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Not a ton of people have done it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And um at the media lab there was this technology that of I don't know discovered ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
um called Swipe.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And they just swipe from one to the other and we we thought that would be great.,0.6249,0.204,0.796,0.0,p79
And it someone like a student like us who had done it.,0.6124,0.333,0.667,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um we but we we didn't realize that it was not production ready and then .,-0.395,0.0,0.849,0.151,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And you know we have all these bugs and stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And we have no documentation to go to.,-0.296,0.0,0.761,0.239,p79
But there was this one person on the team you know being you know the awesome programmer he is insisted on going that way when .,0.7684,0.184,0.816,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Like when we met the founder of Swipe he was saying you know what just don't use it it's not optimized for the stuff that you guys are sending .,0.0052,0.076,0.849,0.075,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
across like the data.,0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0,p79
And um so we have the sort of tiff when you know the rest of the team wanted to move on to do the same project using the VPI.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Which was kind of standard .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79

Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And whereas we infinitely could deduce fiber we just didn't the resources at the time.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
So um you know he was re- he was really experienced and he can't even say you know you don't what you are doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Because he .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79

.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
what he doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
So eventually we were able to convince him that we should probably go with whatever we wanted .,0.25,0.105,0.895,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79

.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79

.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
etc.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um so that was that was definitely a challenging situation cuz he's great.,0.8126,0.457,0.543,0.0,p79
He's smart.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And he's super nice and you don't wanna offend anyone.,0.8219,0.551,0.449,0.0,p79
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Especially when they're your friends.,0.4767,0.437,0.563,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
You you have to get the work done.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Can tell what your weakness is and what you're doing to overcome it?,-0.4215,0.0,0.811,0.189,p79
Is this a technical weakness or .,-0.4215,0.0,0.682,0.318,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Any weakness.,-0.4215,0.0,0.263,0.737,p79
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um a lot of times this is just something that Cody just taught me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
You didn't learn?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
That I haven't quite learned um is that whenever you're you know whenever you're in doubt you should just go ahead and do stuff.,-0.3612,0.0,0.902,0.098,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
But for me I like to like think about it how exactly I'm gonna lose one .,0.4497,0.27,0.582,0.148,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
if ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
coding.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Which which which is a problem because sometimes like new solutions come along the way but you can like I do it fast.,0.5423,0.233,0.699,0.068,p79
Um and it's OK if stuff work the first time.,0.4466,0.246,0.754,0.0,p79
Cuz I kind of wanted to research everything before .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
I start doing stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um that's sometimes an issue because then I can't do it as fast.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
If especially if that's something new.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
But um on the other hand sometimes if it works like it works really well cuz I've done my you know homework.,0.8919,0.359,0.641,0.0,p79
Right?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
But uh in general I like if you just just get my hands dirty and then do stuff.,-0.1531,0.141,0.693,0.167,p79
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p79
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p79
And why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um well because a year ago I didn't know how to code at all.,0.2732,0.139,0.861,0.0,p79
And now like like next semester I'm gonna finish up my degree.,0.6124,0.333,0.667,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Um as a junior.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And then I'll probably do math or something else.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
But it that just kind of shows you that I'm willing to learn.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And I'm not afraid of trying new stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And with this technology will always change.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
And sure if I don't PHP today right now you can use it tomorrow.,0.3182,0.15,0.85,0.0,p79
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
But um I think what's really important is that I'm willing to learn um and I work well with within a team.,0.6474,0.209,0.791,0.0,p79
And I also like working by myself.,0.3612,0.294,0.706,0.0,p79
So there's like a good balance of what um stuff is ?,0.6887,0.362,0.638,0.0,p79
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p79
yeah I just like hanging with great people and doing great work.,0.9169,0.617,0.383,0.0,p79
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p79
So  how are you doing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
I'm doing great  how are you?,0.6249,0.451,0.549,0.0,p8
I'm well  thank you.So  please tell me about yourself.,0.7096,0.535,0.465,0.0,p8
Uh  so I'm an undergraduate uh in the third year  at uh  here at MIT and I'm studying computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
Um  I am really interested in um applying for a software job.Um  I want to get more experience in web development and software development and also get some exposure into data science and machine learning.,0.5095,0.115,0.885,0.0,p8
And uh see how that plays out in uh the industry setting uh since I've done some research Mhmm.,0.25,0.1,0.9,0.0,p8
Tell me how you demonstrate leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
Uhm  leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
So currently I'm on uh the South Asian American Students Exec Board.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
So  that's uh basically uh the Indian Cultural club uh for undergrads.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
And uh I'm secretary and community service chair.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
Um So I'm currently organizing um reaching out to groups in the Boston area um and uh groups that work overseas in India with um for charity and community service opportunities that I can connect to uh undergrads here.Um And uh I'm also involved in other activities that SAS  the group  uh is involved in like setting up and planning like uh study breaks.,0.8807,0.171,0.829,0.0,p8
Our recent uh garba  which is an Indian dance festival.,0.4939,0.262,0.738,0.0,p8
And also in I'm in Phi Kappa Theta fraternity and uh I've held leadership positions there  uh  in my freshman year in our pledge class when I was the community service chair for that  as well.,0.2732,0.057,0.943,0.0,p8
Uh and  led my class of uh 15 in um going out into the community and we went down into different places in Boston and helped clean up streets  etc.,0.4019,0.085,0.915,0.0,p8
So please tell me about a time when you were working in a team and faced a challenge.,0.4391,0.196,0.804,0.0,p8
How did you solve the problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p8
Uh so  with this community service  uh  that my pledge class did for my fraternity.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
Um  one glaring problem was getting everybody to respond  communicate well  and show up.,-0.1531,0.125,0.714,0.161,p8
Uh  a class of 15 isn't too big but when we're all MIT students  we're all just getting settled  it's kind of hard to keep everybody on task.,-0.2592,0.0,0.93,0.07,p8
Um so  what I did to solve this problem was uh I- once I set up- One thing I did was set up a group text um that I would uh that would basically keep us on touch and um would facilitate making sure that everybody stayed involved and it would be easier to keep track also  of who was actually responding.,0.4166,0.101,0.853,0.046,p8
Um because people check texts better than emails and that's what we'd been using previously.I also tried to um unsuccessfully  but um  propose uh like a point system  basically.,0.5187,0.157,0.787,0.056,p8
Uh to reward those who would show up and penalize those who didn't.,0.5719,0.236,0.764,0.0,p8
So  we also- we have chores basically in our house to keep the house looking clean- house works and crews- and um basically if you accumulated a certain number of um points- points are bad-uh you would have to do extra crews or house works  depending on when you didn't show up for an event during our pledge process.,0.6249,0.098,0.902,0.0,p8
Tell me about one of your weaknesses and uh how you plan to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p8
I think probably my biggest weakness is uh staying focused on tasks.,-0.0516,0.169,0.649,0.182,p8
Um  when I am working on a task and I am focused I am able to work really efficiently and I come up with good ideas.,0.8173,0.27,0.73,0.0,p8
Uh but I frequently get distracted.,-0.4767,0.0,0.617,0.383,p8
However  I've been um well on my way to overcoming this uh through friends- working studying with friends who have like trained me to stay more on task.,0.8689,0.31,0.69,0.0,p8
Uh Done things like finding better places to work and study with back to school work.Um and uh also  sleep schedules are frequently a major problem for undergrads in terms of how that affects your study habits.,0.3415,0.127,0.802,0.071,p8
And so uh I've been working on that to help stay fresher and more focused when I do my work.,0.6801,0.237,0.763,0.0,p8
Now  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p8
I think you should hire me because I have a lot of ideas I'm really good at coming up with ideas between table  especially in terms of um software development.,0.4927,0.099,0.901,0.0,p8
I um projects for school and one or two of my own independent projects I've been working on by myself and with friends.,0.4767,0.124,0.876,0.0,p8
I've uh  been good at optimization  um of software and coming up with good ideas um on the user end.,0.8126,0.331,0.669,0.0,p8
So  uh  I'm able to look at a project from different stand points and think about what all parties would want.,0.4588,0.174,0.826,0.0,p8
What-what would be easiest for the development team as well as the end users.,0.5994,0.29,0.71,0.0,p8
Thank you for coming.,0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0,p8
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p8
Ready?,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Awesome.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
How about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
Tell about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Well  I grew up in Berkley  California.,0.2732,0.259,0.741,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
And I've been interested in medicine my whole life.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,p80
Um  my dad worked for UCSF... Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
as a researcher  but not as a doctor.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
And I would visit him at work and I was always attracted to the hospital side... Mhmm.,0.4215,0.149,0.851,0.0,p80
It's much the loud side.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
I want to do research as well.,0.34,0.405,0.595,0.0,p80
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Well in high school I was captain of golf team.,0.2732,0.189,0.811,0.0,p80
And that was a blast.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Golf  girl’s golf is not super competitive... Okay.,-0.652,0.0,0.441,0.559,p80
to say the least.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
It's very...haphazard and it's usually been one extreme or another.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Very bimodal.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Um  you've either got these like super serious girls  who are parents on the course with them and they're going to be all PGA.,0.7269,0.223,0.732,0.045,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Or you just girls that are not that athletic just goofing off with golf clubs... Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
and doing whatever.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
And Berkeley High is definitely the ladder of that.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,p80
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
So I uh  you know  coordinated this group of motley girls along with my coach and we had a lot of competitions where candy was the reward.,0.5719,0.125,0.875,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
We played a lot of games--we had really a great time.,0.7769,0.43,0.57,0.0,p80
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
But a big part of it is like... you know there was like a leadership aspect?,0.7579,0.317,0.683,0.0,p80
We had to like stay organized.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,p80
Especially because no one else was.,-0.3566,0.0,0.669,0.331,p80
Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
And  so like making sure we made it to meets and like...organizing snacks  making sure people showed up.,0.7688,0.338,0.662,0.0,p80
Mmm  okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p80
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p80
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p80
Well  I mean I can continue the same example because I didn't start off as captain.,0.2732,0.123,0.877,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
And it's different  you know?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
When you’re the head versus like part of the group.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p80
Um  it's more important when you're a part of the group to be a cohesive part and not like the leader.,-0.0044,0.09,0.819,0.091,p80
Right  right  right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
To be able to like understand directions and like...I mean if there is an issue like...work it out  but to be able to take  you know  instructions and think about it and work with other people and encourage them to do the same.,0.7351,0.131,0.869,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
So  uh this is one time we've encountered an issue.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
So we were going to a meet  and you have to travel a lot for golf... Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
because golf courses are big and not very common.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Compared to something like a soccer field.,0.3612,0.294,0.706,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
So we were going out into the [xx?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
of California... Mhmm and our car broke down.,-0.4215,0.0,0.714,0.286,p80
Oh goodness.,0.4588,0.75,0.25,0.0,p80
And it was earrrly in the morning.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
No one had no sleep.,-0.5267,0.0,0.405,0.595,p80
It was just girls...teenage girls  no caffeine  not enough sugar  not enough breakfast.,-0.296,0.0,0.845,0.155,p80
And we were in a really old car... Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
and my coach was like 30 minutes ahead and we were going to be late.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,p80
We blew a tire actually.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
So we called triple A  but it was stressful... Uh huh.,-0.6652,0.0,0.692,0.308,p80
but  we ended playing games and I like led a yoga session in the...highway...  Alright.,0.7876,0.398,0.602,0.0,p80
which was  you know  hilarious.,0.4019,0.403,0.597,0.0,p80
And we're there in these ridiculous outfits.,-0.3612,0.0,0.706,0.294,p80
We're wearing like we... at Berkeley High we wore like stupid outfits... Mhmm.,0.1531,0.272,0.543,0.185,p80
on purpose; knee high argyles Mmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
and like polos.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,p80
It was so funny.,0.5777,0.555,0.445,0.0,p80
You can only imagine how we looked.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,p80
Um  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p80
So I'm not super great with being organized.,-0.772,0.0,0.472,0.528,p80
Like  I'm alright  but especially with administrative things like paperwork and...uhm  I...I'm good with deadlines  but only if I had set reminders.,0.8537,0.365,0.635,0.0,p80
So like even for example  trying to get into this building today was an adventure or remembering to fill out all the forms for...like my [xx?],0.624,0.175,0.825,0.0,p80
and everything is...it can be sometimes sort of a struggle.,-0.3804,0.0,0.776,0.224,p80
Mmm  okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,p80
And why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Well  I love helping people and I'm going to be a great doctor.,0.9118,0.583,0.417,0.0,p80
I have good dexterity.,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,p80
I like to study.,0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0,p80
I find medicine fascinating...fascinating.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p80
And I feel like I could really make the most impact that way I can utilize...utilize my skills the best way possible.,0.7717,0.251,0.749,0.0,p80
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p80
-ology in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the rain.,0.4173,0.176,0.824,0.0,p81
Um  and so that’s- I’m trying to get myself towards patent law.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
In pharmaceuticals I guess.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
So tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
Well  um  last semester I was  ah  a part of the Mentor Core for a student organization on one of MIT’s campus called Amphibious Achievement.,0.2732,0.08,0.92,0.0,p81
One of the things  as part of the Mentor Core you have a small group of students that you one on one tutor as their mentor and tutor and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session and they’re inner city High School students who - they don’t have access to the best basic math and reading skills.,0.6369,0.063,0.937,0.0,p81
So we meet once a week to go over what we’re going to teach them and we teach them the next day  on a Sunday.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
Uhm  and so that’s leadership in itself  but I took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank our very generous donors and so me and another member of the Mentor Core planned  uh  a sponsorship banquet that I was told went very well.,0.9048,0.211,0.789,0.0,p81
So  I’m very proud of that.,0.5657,0.422,0.578,0.0,p81
So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p81
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p81
Well  I guess the one thing that I’ve learned  uhm  working on several teams throughout my life is  uh  that communication is necessary  um  so  uh  in High School I worked on a team and we had received a grant in order to build an alternative energy  um  device.,0.6908,0.127,0.873,0.0,p81
Um  and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees  like so there was an electrical component and there were people trying to build the flotation aspect of it because it was - it was supposed to be in water and there was the water proofing committee.,0.3612,0.05,0.95,0.0,p81
And so  in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations I think there was a  sometimes there could be a breakdown in that because everyone’s busy.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
And you see that here and I saw that a lot back in High School.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
Um  and so I was kind of moderating everyone  um and so just being able to communicate the expectations  um  to make it really apparent  ‘cause I think we running a lot of high achieving people a lot of the time  so as long as they know what they need to do and what’s expected of them  I think  um  at least for me as a high achieving person  I - once I know what I need to do I can do it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
And as long as that’s communicated and clear I think that’s necessary to resolve a lot of problems.,0.3612,0.227,0.655,0.118,p81
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p81
So  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it.,-0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,p81
I’d say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization.,0.0516,0.167,0.679,0.154,p81
So if there’s something I know that I need to do  um  I will definitely get it done  but in terms of parsing out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently before hand  sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times I’m scrambling at the last second.,0.7311,0.116,0.884,0.0,p81
I always get it done  but it’s just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end  um  but I have  I’ve gotten a lot better at that  especially at MIT  because you really can’t mess around with that kind of  uh  weakness.,-0.8877,0.077,0.709,0.214,p81
Just with  knowing my schedule the month before versus the week before hand.,0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,p81
And investing in a planner and a calendar has definitely helped me a lot.,0.4019,0.172,0.828,0.0,p81
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p81
And why do you think you should go to law school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p81
I think because  you know  I’ve wanted to do it since I was twelve and I think I have a lot that I can give  coming from Mit have a back-like the mind set the science and engineering  um  as and adding that into like the sphere of law I think it would introduce a unique problem solving set and I could have a lot to offer to  uh  the community of lawyers across the nation.,0.296,0.061,0.906,0.033,p81
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  I'm good  I'm good.,0.7003,0.659,0.341,0.0,p83
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p83
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  so  I'm a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
I'm studying brain and cognitive science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
I'm interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,p83
Probably systems level.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p83
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  well  this past summer I was in China.,0.2732,0.208,0.792,0.0,p83
And  umm  I was helping out with this cognitive learning program.,0.296,0.18,0.82,0.0,p83
And what they do  is they try take principles  umm  learned through research  and apply those in the classroom.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
And so- OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
- we were applying those  umm  to students who were in sixth grade  trying to teach them English.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
And  it was  it was great.,0.6249,0.451,0.549,0.0,p83
So  I got to actually  like  umm  go there and teach a class of sixth graders for the whole summer.,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,p83
So  umm  and they let me develop some of their curriculum  which was very cool.,0.3804,0.156,0.844,0.0,p83
And  umm and it was a great experience overall.,0.6249,0.339,0.661,0.0,p83
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p83
Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p83
How did you solve that problem.,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p83
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  well  actually  a part of the same program  uh  we were trying to put up videos of the teaching to give  umm  examples for other people.,0.2732,0.075,0.925,0.0,p83
And  uh  none of us knew how to program or anything like that  and we were  we were in China  so it was  umm  both a language barrier and also  you know like  overcoming that  like  knowledge gap of not knowing how to program.,0.7184,0.153,0.816,0.031,p83
So  what we ended up doing was  like  trying to find a Chinese student who was studying computer science  and  umm  in Beijing  and  the language thing did come in to play  but  umm  but eventually  we were able to  like  sort of  get through that.,0.6908,0.135,0.865,0.0,p83
It was a challenge all the way through.,0.0772,0.157,0.843,0.0,p83
Mmhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p83
And can you tell me one of your weakness and what you are doing to overcome it.,-0.4215,0.0,0.851,0.149,p83
Yea  umm  so  I have trouble public spe-  like  getting up in front of people and talking.- Mmhm.,-0.1189,0.116,0.745,0.138,p83
Umm  which is part of why I came in to this interview.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  but also this semester  I joined the debate team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  which has been great  so far.,0.6249,0.406,0.594,0.0,p83
Umm  basically  we go around to different colleges for tournaments and  umm  we get up and we just speak for  for an hour.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
And  umm  and that's  that's really helped out so far.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p83
And why do you think you should get into graduate school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
Umm  because  I  I want to make a difference in this field.,0.0772,0.106,0.894,0.0,p83
Umm I'm very  very committed to this [??],0.4645,0.302,0.698,0.0,p83
I mean  I know this is what I want to do.,0.0772,0.115,0.885,0.0,p83
I mean  there's really nothing else I can see myself in the future doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p83
I mean  I love it  I'm fully committed  and  umm  I'd  I'd like to make a difference here.,0.8439,0.377,0.623,0.0,p83
So  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
I'm well thank you.,0.5574,0.697,0.303,0.0,p84
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
How about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Pretty Good.,0.7269,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
Tell me about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Alright Um  well as you probably know  I'm a Junior in MIT  ah material science and engineering  and i've spent a bit of time doing some research in material science  but i've also recently declared a maj-  ah  minor in course two.,0.2617,0.071,0.929,0.0,p84
Which is  sorry  its mechanical engineering.,-0.0772,0.0,0.794,0.206,p84
Umm  so  I'm looking for a bit of practice in industry.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Now that I've had some research experience  I've a lot of range of classes in engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Mhmm  And I'm hoping to  ah  to kind of try out what it's like to engineer  um   combine the two basically  mechanical and materials engineering.,0.6486,0.187,0.813,0.0,p84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Ok  um  I could give you an example of a club I'm in?,0.296,0.155,0.845,0.0,p84
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
Um  in  at MIT I'm in Amnesty International  which is a student human rights organization- Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
And it's very  um  decentralized  it's very student owned  and  uh  we kinda make it what ever we wanna make it- Sure.,0.3182,0.099,0.901,0.0,p84
at any given time  so it takes a lot of initiative to- Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
really hold the club together  and  uh  we were trying to pull together a big event last semester which involved Professor N- Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
and we had to talk about Arab spring and we were hosting it in a huge lecture hall  um  so big venue  hoping  expecting a lot of people.,0.6557,0.171,0.829,0.0,p84
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Um  but it took a lot of work- Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
And none of us had really pulled such a huge event before- Mhmm.,0.3182,0.161,0.839,0.0,p84
So  um  I'd say it took  it took a lot of initiative that I hadn't taken before in pulling that event together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
I came to meetings and made sure everyone was on task  made sure  Mmm.,0.5574,0.277,0.723,0.0,p84
that everybody had an awareness of what could go wrong as well as what could  um  what kind of repercussions we might be expecting if things did fall out of hand with the high  high profile speakers- Sure.,0.5423,0.17,0.761,0.069,p84
as well as some  you know  some contentious issues- Sure.,0.296,0.324,0.515,0.162,p84
being discussed  so  um  yeah I did my best  to really pull the team together as best as I could.,0.8974,0.39,0.61,0.0,p84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
Um  I didn't have an official leadership role- Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
So  my participation was ambiguously defined  but  um  it was fun having  uh  having a role.,0.6652,0.229,0.771,0.0,p84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
And tell me about a time you were working on a team a faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.08,0.92,0.0,p84
How did you solve that problem?,-0.2263,0.212,0.471,0.318,p84
Um  that's a good question.,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,p84
Um  so I was on the orientation group  I was an orientation leader this-  Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
this  the beginning of this year  and so  we paired off into different groups  uh  we were the brown team  and we had a few problems with getting energy with the team  and  uh  all of these freshman we knew that they were excited to be there-  Of course.,0.2023,0.085,0.865,0.051,p84
We knew that they wanted to get to know each other and MIT  but there was just  there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have  so  we  uh  we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team  we had a group discussion  after I think it was the second day  and  we took this  um  we took a few tries to pull together some new ice breakers that hadn't been in the booklet that they prepared us for  and just  uh  whipped that out the next day  started yelling  got the kids off their feet and jumping  and um  my  one of my other co-orientation leaders and I were yelling different questions at them and they had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them  and   it didn't really work necessarily  um  everybody participated though and it got them  got the blood moving  and it go them kind of talking to new people  so even though the game didn't have a point  it ended up being kind of fun  it was a good  good way of getting to know my teammates a well.,0.9233,0.078,0.906,0.016,p84
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,p84
So we worked together really well on that.,0.3384,0.255,0.745,0.0,p84
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to over come it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.865,0.135,p84
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
Um  so I have a weakness for over-committing sometimes  and  uh  what I have been doing in the last year or so  well since I came to MIT  but particularly this year is cutting back on things that don't mean much to me.,-0.1973,0.041,0.879,0.08,p84
Cutting back on things that are  that have always just been interest that I never see myself progressing in.,0.3612,0.14,0.791,0.07,p84
So  um  for example  I was  uh  I took a small leadership role in my sorority  like  my  my freshman year  but I wasn't  I don't see myself going very far in leadership in my sorority  so I cut that kind of thing out and I've been focusing on classes  sailing  I'm on the sailing team  and  uh  Amnesty International  and those are my three main focus things  so although  I do do other things.,-0.3221,0.022,0.938,0.039,p84
Like I was and orientation leader  um  when I have time I give tours  from  thats my job campus tour guiding  but  um  I've been getting better  I've been staying more on track with classes this way  and  um  having sailing has definitely helped  so a bit of self-discipline- Right.,0.8462,0.163,0.837,0.0,p84
And  uh  cutting back on things has  helping me  uh  not overcommit.,0.1779,0.161,0.73,0.109,p84
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
And  why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p84
Um  because I've researched into your country  sorry into your company  and  um  I think  uh  I think it's  I see a lot of  I see a lot it in the experience that I've had  in  I've had international experience in companies of a scales similar to yours  although  it was in the research department  um  and  I think I cold bring that  coo-  that  um  international perspective  I've lived in several countries as well  uh  and I have  besides being and engineer  I have a lot practice with team work and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups  even in my p-set groups  um  doing homework.,0.2023,0.019,0.969,0.012,p84
We have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of  uh  group reports where the materials signs major here  and  I've really  uh  I've developed a lot of skills that I think will really help your company.,0.4576,0.071,0.929,0.0,p84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,p84
So please tell me about yourself Okay so I’m a junior here at MIT  I’m [???],0.6166,0.264,0.736,0.0,p85
um and I guess so it’s an interesting combo but engineering and ECS and I think I just came to MIT thinking I’d do bioengineering and then I guess I took a program class for the first time my freshman year over IP and I guess I just really fell in love with the logic.,0.8473,0.134,0.866,0.0,p85
I worked in a couple of biology labs and I guess the one frustrating thing is that like experiments take weeks or months to set up sometimes things just go wrong and you don’t really know why.,-0.5423,0.059,0.8,0.141,p85
And then I think I like the instantaneous feedback of like [???],0.6747,0.356,0.644,0.0,p85
so last year I decided to double major and this year I’m really checking out the more computer science side of things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p85
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,p85
Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p85
Okay um so I think I’m on my class council  so one of the things we have to do was to seven people elected every year our job was to plan events for the class for event unity  just like study breaks but sometimes it goes beyond that.,0.296,0.065,0.935,0.0,p85
And I guess through that role often times I’ve um just like seen an idea from inception all the way to it’s now in planning to like delegating tasks to day of  to day of execution and just following that entirely through.,0.6124,0.111,0.889,0.0,p85
So I guess that just involved first just coming out brainstorming some ideas so like for example this past week on Tuesday  since it’s a hell week for many people at MIT we decided to have instead of like a big study break where people had to go on campus  we rented out a cookie monster truck from Boston and then just drove around.,0.0364,0.08,0.855,0.064,p85
We had six stops on campus to like it was all the dorms and even across the river to bring the study break to them so people didn’t have to spend that much time just cookies and hot cocoa.,0.2263,0.061,0.9,0.039,p85
So I guess my role is well I thought of the idea and then just coordinate the people and made shifts to people and designed the stops and then just made sure publicity was good and everything came together in the end.,0.6908,0.156,0.81,0.034,p85
It’s a very smart idea.,0.4576,0.428,0.572,0.0,p85
I like it.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,p85
So tell me a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.085,0.915,0.0,p85
How did you go about resolving it?,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,p85
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p85
So I guess I’m in a fraternity and then one of the things we have like a lot of officers and I guess one of the things is that sometimes people obviously it’s MIT people get very busy and I guess one of the things is people maybe they have an ambitious goal and then it just happens that they get busy or like they lose track of things and then uh they get side tracked and it’s always challenging to try to keep them engaged into that officer position and like because for a couple of reasons: one like do you want to make it rewarding for then  two you want to see them follow their goals  and three they’re like setting an example for say like younger students or other people that may be interesting.,0.9732,0.198,0.784,0.017,p85
So I guess the challenge then is to overcome this so I’m usually following up with them individually seeing  like  maybe like  hey like what’s up are you no longer interested in this are you just busy?,0.5175,0.199,0.7,0.101,p85
And then I think it depends on like a case by case basis.,0.3612,0.172,0.828,0.0,p85
Like are they just maybe a little bit absent minded then maybe like setting like weekly just like deliverables or like milestones or goals to like get it done piece by piece is one way.,0.9186,0.341,0.659,0.0,p85
If they’re not interested anymore maybe you try to think of like some other idea that they may be interested in or willing to plan to maybe they can work in a group with someone else so someone else can keep them on track.,0.4482,0.107,0.846,0.047,p85
So I guess it’s just tailoring to the solution to the individual problem.,-0.1027,0.144,0.688,0.169,p85
Yes  that’s always the best approach.,0.7845,0.633,0.367,0.0,p85
So unh tell me about one of your weakness and how you plan to overcome it.,-0.4215,0.0,0.843,0.157,p85
Okay um I think sometimes I can be um a little like  uh like unsure of myself or like doubting when making a very large decision so I guess usually in leadership roles I prefer something like second in command since I do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure but I always like the fall back of having someone else to consult with to talk about uh my thought process and things like that.,0.9227,0.232,0.734,0.035,p85
And I guess generally I try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people like other people on the team or someone else you would maybe not [???],0.5913,0.143,0.857,0.0,p85
but has experience in the field just to maybe illustrate my thought process  see if they see any flaws  see if they see maybe  a perspective I didn’t think about and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that I feel more confident in my own decision or like I reevaluate it to account for things that maybe I didn’t think of before.,0.8397,0.113,0.887,0.0,p85
Ah yes  that’s always a good strategy.,0.6808,0.528,0.472,0.0,p85
So now I’d like you to think of a job that you’d like to have.,0.6444,0.288,0.712,0.0,p85
Do you have one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p85
Um so actually that’s one of the things like I’m hoping to figure out … Okay that wasn’t the question.,0.7351,0.298,0.702,0.0,p85
I want you to picture one that you’d like to have.,0.4215,0.297,0.703,0.0,p85
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p85
For an interview situation.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p85
Now tell me why you should have this job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p85
Okay so I guess the job I picked was just to listing like Richard Keppel?,0.5267,0.253,0.747,0.0,p85
Where like they listen to a lot of pitches and they decide like what to fund and I think the reason why I want to  should I say why I should or why I want to have that job?,0.6808,0.178,0.822,0.0,p85
Why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p85
Okay so why I should have the job is I think at MIT I’ve gotten a lot of exposure to a lot of different things one is through the breadth of my coursework I guess I’m in two very different fields.,0.2263,0.045,0.955,0.0,p85
Another is just through my interaction with people on campus like being on class council  being involved in a fraternity   I guess I um I’ve seen like a lot of different groups of people.,0.6124,0.135,0.865,0.0,p85
And um I guess I’m just constantly around lots of awesome people with awesome ideas and I really enjoy just listening to them.,0.9134,0.369,0.631,0.0,p85
And then a lot of the times I’ve helped people to develop maybe they’ve got a gold mine of a plan and I’ve helped them work through  especially like sophomores or freshman in the fraternity  putting that plan in action.,0.4201,0.067,0.933,0.0,p85
SO I think that I would be a good candidate because I’ve had experience listening to ideas  I can identify problem areas just because I have a lot of experience executing those ideas.,0.0516,0.079,0.847,0.074,p85
So I can both see what might be a good idea technically as well as to see if there’s a good plan to set forth an action and get it done.,0.7845,0.22,0.78,0.0,p85
Excellent well thanks for coming in with us today.,0.8271,0.592,0.408,0.0,p85
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p85
So  please tell me about yourself.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,p86
Umm  like where I'm from  that type of stuff?,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,p86
Okay  umm  I'm Junior  M.I.T.. I come from South Florida  born and raised  so cold weather's kind of rough for a guy like me but that's alright.,0.5719,0.192,0.808,0.0,p86
It's kind of a nice break from the heat of South Florida.,0.4215,0.203,0.797,0.0,p86
Umm  I've been playing music ever since I was four  so that's kind of been a big part of my life.,0.2023,0.083,0.917,0.0,p86
Umm  but music tech  I mean  technology honestly also  so umm.,0.6124,0.286,0.714,0.0,p86
Course two here  which is Mechanical Engineering  um  but I'm also dabbling in Electrical  looking along for sides of control that type of stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Robotics  if you will.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
And just had one of my  my second or third robot finished last week  which was a freakin' nightmare.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
But you know  it's ok  it's done  it was  it was a good time  so  yeah.,0.8717,0.432,0.568,0.0,p86
That's  that's what I do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Yeah  umm  I guess that's... That's good for you!,0.6588,0.435,0.565,0.0,p86
That's good  that's good.,0.7003,0.744,0.256,0.0,p86
Yeah  alright.,0.4939,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
Uh  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,p86
Robot building is always a fun pastime.,0.5106,0.355,0.645,0.0,p86
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
So  can you tell me about a time where you demonstrated leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Um  Well I guess I'm  uh  usually pretty calm and collected  so  if I ever notice  like  in a group setting if someone's like  you know  there's  there's disagreement between the two  like in my robotics group  for example.,0.891,0.304,0.645,0.05,p86
The two guys  they're best buds  but they often  like  just get really heated  like  you know  I  eff you  why  why don't we just do this  and that type of stuff.,0.8597,0.247,0.753,0.0,p86
So... Yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p86
... In order to  like  keep it going and being productive  someone has to be like you know  just  guys  just calm down and keep doing it  so that's  that's like  just  here and there.,0.8428,0.245,0.755,0.0,p86
Not really super-like I'm in control  you know  at least saying guys  we need to calm down and take a step forward.,0.3182,0.099,0.901,0.0,p86
I feel like that's a little  minor leadership role I've got to take there.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,p86
Um  other leadership roles  um  I  I play in a group  like a band  jazz group  so I often  you know  we all got to get together  and like  kind of talk.,0.7506,0.203,0.797,0.0,p86
Any  any group setting in which I'm often in  I have to  like  somebody has to take control  and I don't often take control initially  but  you know  if something is not going in a certain direction  or the right direction  I often feel like maybe I can push it there very subtly.,0.7684,0.133,0.867,0.0,p86
So  leadership in a very subtle way  but not in a  like  a bam  I'm telling you what to do.,-0.395,0.0,0.877,0.123,p86
Anyway.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
That's  that's what I like doing.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,p86
Ah  that make's sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
So uh  tell me a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p86
How did you go about solving it?,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,p86
Um  okay  so  for example  the robotics group  um  we worked very last minute  and just having to be one of those things where we were all busy with other things  and we didn't really think about the scheduling  like when it was actually  when the project was actually going to be due.,0.5267,0.079,0.921,0.0,p86
So  um  basically we all had to work really hard  last minute  and  of course  you know  things don't always go according to plan  so we  like  we tried to build one thing  and machine something  and it ended up not being perfect the first time  so we have to go back and redesign it  or re-machine it  so uh  we had to re-machine a few things a couple times.,-0.2294,0.037,0.9,0.063,p86
And  you know  it's like  six in the morning  and you've been working in the lab for like  thirteen hours and you've got to keep going  so  you've got to stay positive and keep  and  you know  even though you may not finish  or like  you know  you kind of  you can't really think about not finishing.,0.7572,0.135,0.832,0.033,p86
You just have to go for it  keep finishing  keep working  eventually you're good  with the mind set that you are going to finish.,0.4404,0.112,0.888,0.0,p86
So that's  uh  adversity in that way.,-0.4703,0.0,0.662,0.338,p86
Just  you know  always stay positive  and keep looking towards the future  keep working.,0.5574,0.217,0.783,0.0,p86
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you've done to try and overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.878,0.122,p86
So um  time-management  um  is one of my weaknesses  which is not always the best to admit in an interview  but you know  whatever  uh  that's alright.,-0.0088,0.126,0.746,0.128,p86
What I've been doing to get better about it  is  you know  sometimes you've got to look like  even a week in advance  I've discovered  especially at M.I.T.,0.6597,0.172,0.828,0.0,p86
isn't as far as you need to go.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
So  like this  this week for instance  I had  like  three  like  a final robot project  another presentation I had to take care of  and  you know  a lab  a couple P-sets.,0.8748,0.282,0.718,0.0,p86
Like  you just  I didn't realize how much work was coming up until like  last Thursday or something like that  which is when I started working  but even then  you know  I didn't have enough time.,0.5023,0.137,0.863,0.0,p86
I really should have started working  you know  Monday  on it  when I was just relaxing  and was like Oh  you know.,0.6908,0.222,0.778,0.0,p86
I've got P-sets to do this week  but I can really relax and it will be all right.,0.6474,0.201,0.799,0.0,p86
So  uh  in terms of improving that  just I  you know  got to work  write up a schedule  and look  really far in advance  make sure I really see what's coming.,0.6249,0.15,0.85,0.0,p86
Yeah  so I've been trying  I've been being better.,0.6249,0.421,0.579,0.0,p86
It started off  I started college  like  I didn't see things for like  three days in advance  two days in advance.,0.6124,0.208,0.792,0.0,p86
Now it's kind of like  a week  week and a half I'm looking in advance.,0.2975,0.136,0.864,0.0,p86
I'm getting there  slowly but surely.,0.5927,0.435,0.565,0.0,p86
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
And  now think of a job you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p86
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
You have one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Uh  yeah sure.,0.5423,0.818,0.182,0.0,p86
So why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
For that job  you mean?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
Umm  I feel like I know what I'm doing now.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,p86
Um  I'll say there was a point in time where I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing  and I've been one of those guys that  like  you know  you can apply to a job  and say  you know  yeah  there's no harm in applying  which I've kind of figured out  eventually  yeah there is no harm in applying  I agree.,0.8999,0.206,0.765,0.029,p86
But  at the same time  I feel like there's kind of  like a  an obligation to actually know what you're doing for that job  and right now I feel like I know what I'm doing.,0.8523,0.225,0.775,0.0,p86
At least  a lot more so than I did last year  or even last semester  so at the rate I'm going  I feel like  you know  another semester of classes that I'm taking  I'll really know what I'm doing  and then some more time in the field  or at the job  it'll piece together and I'll actually feel pretty confident.,0.836,0.135,0.865,0.0,p86
So  that's... Okay.,0.2911,0.521,0.479,0.0,p86
... That's why  I guess.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p86
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,p86
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,p86
I appreciate you coming today.,0.4019,0.403,0.597,0.0,p86
Please tell me about yourself.,0.3182,0.365,0.635,0.0,p89
Um so I’m a junior at MIT here and um I’m a physics major and I uh  yeah  besides classes  I’m involved in the juggling club and uh let’s see and I’m from Pensacola  Florida and I’ve lived there uh ever since I  I was born there  grew up there and I um yeah  lived there and moved up here.,0.5267,0.071,0.929,0.0,p89
Yeah I’m in Zeta Psy fraternity and uh yeah so  yeah  right above Chicago Pizza.,0.1027,0.227,0.619,0.155,p89
And uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail  or just general?,0.3612,0.212,0.788,0.0,p89
Yeah  um yeah so I uh I don’t too much as far as extra-curricular but I was involved with Frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team  there’s not a varsity team here.,0.6,0.148,0.852,0.0,p89
I was pretty good  liked that a lot.,0.836,0.64,0.36,0.0,p89
And uh I’m not sure as far as career wise what I want to go into but as a physics major I’m looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related.,0.1825,0.101,0.852,0.047,p89
Uh and yeah but I’m trying to size that up right now.,0.1531,0.127,0.873,0.0,p89
Junior’s a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things.,0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,p89
Yeah so brief summary of me.,0.296,0.306,0.694,0.0,p89
Good so tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,p89
Um well high school uh senior year probably the best time.,0.743,0.412,0.588,0.0,p89
I helped organize a math competition um so there was no major middle school math competition in Pensacola  Florida and so I just teamed up with a few people with my year in high school and we helped organize a competition.,-0.3535,0.0,0.942,0.058,p89
It’s been going on for the past three years and uh hopefully it’ll go further.,0.4019,0.162,0.838,0.0,p89
That was one of the most stressful things but the most rewarding as well and yeah so as far as leadership goes.,0.8621,0.349,0.577,0.074,p89
I mean more recently I guess juggling club has been my main leadership thing  we organize different gigs and perform various places so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p89
So uh tell a time when you were working in a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,p89
How did you go about solving it?,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,p89
Um so that would most commonly have been this past semester  I took junior lab which is the physics lab class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p89
Lots of challenges frequently.,0.0772,0.302,0.698,0.0,p89
It was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically I guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment.,-0.1779,0.062,0.881,0.057,p89
I guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because it’s so easy to I don’t know get like get in your head and you’re working with somebody so they’ll be thinking one thing and you’ll be thinking another.,0.7384,0.127,0.873,0.0,p89
Yeah I guess that’s not very specific but I mean yeah that’s the first thing that came to mind so.,0.5267,0.196,0.804,0.0,p89
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p89
Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?,-0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,p89
Yeah weakness?,-0.1531,0.44,0.0,0.56,p89
I guess I uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that I’ve kind of come to the realization of recently.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p89
I need to um I don’t know I’ve been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what I’ll do after.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p89
Self-advocacy is like a huge thing and I haven’t really gotten too much into that but I feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like self-advocacy.,0.9413,0.375,0.625,0.0,p89
Whether it’s like having your own website or just like general networking.,0.6124,0.333,0.667,0.0,p89
I don’t know that’s something that I realize that I need to kind of work on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p89
Okay thank you that was important.,0.6369,0.674,0.326,0.0,p89
So now think about a job that you’d like to have.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,p89
Okay do you have one in mind?,0.2263,0.241,0.759,0.0,p89
Um yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,p89
Good okay  so now why do you think you should have this job?,0.5859,0.304,0.696,0.0,p89
Why do I think I should have this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,p89
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,p89
Um I feel like I’m a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic I feel like I really do have those strengths.,0.9403,0.382,0.618,0.0,p89
Yeah I feel like I communicate pretty well for um  I’m not saying you know general physics majors can’t communicate well  just in general I feel like especially this past semester I’ve taken a lab classes I’ve been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um I kind of found a strength there and so I think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important.,0.9657,0.279,0.721,0.0,p89
So um yeah I feel I’m pretty qualified there.,0.6887,0.448,0.552,0.0,p89
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,p89
So please tell me about your background.,0.3804,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp1
Umm  so I’m a computer science and biology major here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
I’m a junior and I’m expecting to graduate in June 2014.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
Ahm  I’m interested in kinda doing both research and  as well as practical application of some type of biological research with computational engineering involved.,0.5859,0.179,0.821,0.0,pp1
Sorry  would you like to know more or is that alright?,0.4939,0.326,0.58,0.094,pp1
I’m more interested in how long you can talk as long as you like.,0.6697,0.314,0.686,0.0,pp1
For instance if you turn these around 180 that’s one of the reasons giving you a funny look.,0.6486,0.249,0.751,0.0,pp1
Do you think you’re a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
Uhm  I do  I would say that when situations present themselves I step up to the occasion.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
I’m not afraid to take the lead on a project or like.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp1
For example I guess  um  for one of my computer science projects that we were working on a group together one of our teammates wasn’t working well  I wasn’t afraid to kind of step up and take the lead  and be like “hey we gotta get this done.”  And  um  it’s kind of happened multiple times before I guess.,0.5574,0.075,0.925,0.0,pp1
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
Give me an example where there’s a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.131,0.754,0.116,pp1
Um  so one of the other organizations I do is Camp Kesem and I’m actually on their exec board.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
And so a lot of what we do is we plan out the summer camp for our kids whose parents have cancer.,-0.6597,0.0,0.827,0.173,pp1
And a lot of times we’re just debating simply like how exactly we want to get  uh  or how we want the whole camp to you know  uh  kinda go day by day we need plan out the whole schedule.,0.4767,0.121,0.879,0.0,pp1
So we have a lot of conflict because everyone has all these different ideas and this is a very team oriented board and although it’s got the normal hierarchal structure  uh  we do a lot of things like just simply by like mapping them out on the board and visualizing the day and schedules and planning between us and what the teens have to do where we’re able to come up with a solution together.,0.6124,0.091,0.881,0.029,pp1
So I would say that it’s a good example of me being one of a team and coming up with a solution together.,0.6369,0.198,0.802,0.0,pp1
If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
Um  I think I’d like to be more interested in academia and even research.,0.6697,0.314,0.686,0.0,pp1
Uh  I enjoy what I do  but I’ve seen some awesome things that you can do if you-I don’t fault them for pursing a career in peer research  which is why I think it’s kind of interesting why I’d admire myself more if I were more interested in that field  but - Why do you think you should get the job?,0.9473,0.245,0.709,0.046,pp1
Ah  I think I’m qualified and I think I’ll bring a lot to the company  I-I fit in well with the environment here.,0.5574,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp1
And  uh  it’s something that I’ve always wanted to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp1
Well  thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp1
I appreciate you coming today.,0.4019,0.403,0.597,0.0,pp1
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp1
So  tell me about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  so  um  I’m a third-year student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  uh  my major is aerospace engineering; and I  um… my  my background is primarily in fluid mechanics and control  and so that’s why I’m interviewing for this position.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  and  um  the applications I’m primarily interested in are in rotorcraft  uh  design  and  uh  analysis.,0.4019,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp10
And uh  um  and I’m really excited about what your company is doing.,0.4005,0.183,0.817,0.0,pp10
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp10
So do you think you’re a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  so  yes.,0.4576,0.599,0.401,0.0,pp10
I think I  I think that I… I don’t think that a leader is the first adjective I’d pull out to describe myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  but I think it’s something that I definitely  a role I definitely step into  um  when  when the need arises or when  um  I think that it’s appropriate.,0.7964,0.208,0.792,0.0,pp10
Um  whether I seek that out  I think really depends on the context  but  um  I definitely see myself as someone who can act independently  uh  can make decisions independently  can act on those decisions  and  uh  can manage people in order  um  to get sort of positive results.,0.8406,0.146,0.854,0.0,pp10
Do you think of yourself as a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp10
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
OK  um  so  um… so when I worked for  um  the computer science and artificial intelligence lab in freshman year  I  um  had  had an issue  um  with one of the students I was working with  um  um  and we had a disagreement about how to handle some part of the project.,0.5473,0.105,0.852,0.043,pp10
Um  it was  it was more of a mechanical issue about what direction we should take  um  and without getting too into details  I think  um  going back to the leadership issue  um  the way I  the way I handled this issue was  um  to sit down and address the issue very directly  um  and to have a frank conversation about what we both wanted  evaluate where we both were  and  uh  talk through the options and make a decision right there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Not letting an issue linger; um  I think that’s generally my style.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
That makes a lot of sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
So  uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  that’s not a question I’ve been asked a lot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
I think there are a few things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  one that comes to mind immediately is my written communication skills.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
Um  I definitely know that’s something that I need to work on and  um  would love the opportunity to improve on that.,0.9118,0.412,0.588,0.0,pp10
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp10
So from what I’ve seen so far in the interview and visiting  um  I’m really excited about this position I think this is somewhere I would fit  where I would fit in a lot.,0.7713,0.199,0.801,0.0,pp10
Um  I’m really excited about what I would be doing and the people I would be working with  and  um  I would just love to sort of get my hands dirty.,0.6115,0.182,0.741,0.077,pp10
And  um  I think I’m pretty well-equipped to do so and to contribute in doing so.,0.4939,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp10
Um  so I’d love that opportunity.,0.8062,0.645,0.355,0.0,pp10
Well  thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp10
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp10
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp10
I appreciate your time interviewing  the…,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp10
So  tell me a little bit about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Um so I am a student here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
I'm a junior studying biology and management.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Um  I am very interested in finance  specifically investment banking or consulting.,0.4576,0.214,0.786,0.0,pp11
Uh  I've taken a bunch of different management finance classes  as well as interned in business management... uh I've also done laboratory research and I'm working in a small consulting firm part time.,0.2732,0.062,0.938,0.0,pp11
As  as of now  so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp11
Do you think you're a leader  and why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Um  I think I'm a leader  I think I know how to command respect in certain situations.,0.6369,0.257,0.743,0.0,pp11
Um  I know how to work together on a team  I think that's very important  uh  especially in the positions that I'm working at I think working with a group of people  being able to encourage them  uh  to work towards a certain goal  uh  shows my leadership characteristics.,0.7574,0.14,0.86,0.0,pp11
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
And  do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
And can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it.,-0.1531,0.074,0.826,0.1,pp11
Um I defiantly consider myself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
I think a lot of the different internships and experiences I've had have forced me to work on a team.,-0.4588,0.0,0.864,0.136,pp11
Um  specifically  uh  in the class that I'm taking right now  uh 5279 which is management communication  we are working on a team project together and we... when deciding on our topic uh for the team project  we had a lot of different disagreements  a lot of people had different ideas  uh and I think I kind of forced people to look at what they were saying  versus just like splurting out ideas  focusing on how their idea would actually turn out in a presentation.,-0.5563,0.028,0.905,0.067,pp11
Um  and so trying to get people to compromise  um  and in the end we ended up picking my idea  so... Great.,0.6249,0.163,0.837,0.0,pp11
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Uh  well  I think I'd like to be taller  that kind of thing (laughs) ... but other than that  uh  I think I wish I was more outgoing in certain situations.,0.9222,0.379,0.621,0.0,pp11
Um  I think sometimes I'm more reserved  or in class  I'm a little hesitant to participate if I'm not sure I'm a hundred percent correct.,-0.3958,0.0,0.862,0.138,pp11
I think its kind of a MIT mentality  everyone likes to be right all the time.,0.4215,0.157,0.843,0.0,pp11
So I think  uh  I have less reser... er  if I had less reservations  about like  answering questions  that would be great.,0.7458,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp11
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
And... why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
Um  I think with my academic experience  as well as my internship experiences I have enough uh  past um  data now assessing quantitative work as well as communication skills and leadership experience  um  and I have a nice balance of skills going into the position.,0.7184,0.143,0.857,0.0,pp11
And  I am a fast learner.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp11
I'm willing to learn on the job  so I think the combination of all that would be good.,0.4404,0.146,0.854,0.0,pp11
Great,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp11
So tell me a little bit more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp12
Yea so  Im a member clinical engineering student at MIT  I'm a Junior  um my main focus is in robotics and product design so I'm real interested in personal robotics and robotic side helps people on a daily basis.,0.6771,0.131,0.869,0.0,pp12
oh ok  great.,0.743,0.863,0.137,0.0,pp12
Um do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp12
Tell me why Um yea  I do think I'm a leader  um...why I'm a leader  um I think that I'm very good at communicating with people and allowing people to be able to do something as a group together so somewhat facilitate in communication between others as well as communicating myself to others um and that way and also being able to motivate people and make sure they are on track with whatever they need to do in that way  um I think to some extent um people can look up to me in terms of you know  what I've done in the past with education or other  other things like that Great!,0.944,0.138,0.862,0.0,pp12
Do you consider yourself a team player and can you give an example of a time you were on a team and there was a problem and you had to resolve it.,-0.0258,0.074,0.85,0.076,pp12
Ok yea  so I do consider myself a team player  I'm currently in a robotics class right now that's a team project based and its me and 3 other students and we recently had to decide on a design for a robot and there is a little bit of not  not like total  you know  people not agreeing but there we had to decide between 2 main  2 different designs and there's a little bit of friction between 2 people versus 2 people of the 4 person team and we need to decide on the majority so um being a team player we were able to kind of mix the 2 designs to a certain extent so that we can all agree on one and i think by being a team leader or team player um  excuse me  I was able to compromise to some extent or give my ideas on how we can combine the two.,0.781,0.064,0.927,0.009,pp12
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp12
And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp12
Ah  I think if I could change one thing about myself...in terms like personality I assume you mean  um I probably...that's a hard questions...I probably change the fact that I feel like I need to be constantly doing everything at once so I think sometimes I need to focus on one thing other than another cause I do have a really large variety of interest and I wish I had some way to not so I'd get rid of those interests  but recognize that I do need to focus out on one thing or one task at one time instead of doing everything at once.,0.6858,0.081,0.908,0.011,pp12
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp12
And last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp12
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp12
Ah  I think I could be really a beneficial part of adding to your company and it would give me a good opportunity to learn from the people that you guys have currently employed um so  if I was given that opportunity both learn from them but also that I'd give benefit to what you guys are doing I think would be great Great!,0.9733,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp12
So  can you tell me a little bit more about your background?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Um  I'm a junior at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
Um  I first became interested in engineering in high school when I did a summer internship at a lab at materials science lab at UC Berkley  and since then I've taken  uh  several courses related to circuits and other eletrical engineering topics.,0.4019,0.062,0.938,0.0,pp13
And worked at  uh  electrical engineering labs at Standford and MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
And  I've also worked in places like Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the Silicon Valley.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,pp13
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Do you think you're a leader and tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Uh  yes.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,pp13
I've had several experiences where I've had to innovate and work with  take charge of a project and work with other people.,0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,pp13
For instance  I'm part of the MIT SAE team  and basically it's a club that builds a race car every year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Oh wow  okay.,0.6908,0.851,0.149,0.0,pp13
Um  and  as of  so  we need a lot of money for sponsorship.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
But  as of the end of last year  the website was pretty much defunct.,0.6486,0.249,0.751,0.0,pp13
So  I decided to take over as webmaster and one of my  and  over the summer and the beginning of the school year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
I set up a new one that's nicely designed  and to get it up  I had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that I needed.,0.4404,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp13
For instance  the specs of the car  pictures of the car  different events for PR and things like that.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,pp13
And  it's done now  so it's online now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team that you had to resolve.,0.0772,0.082,0.846,0.072,pp13
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Ah yes because.,0.4019,0.574,0.426,0.0,pp13
Uh  for instance  I'm also on the (inaudible).,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
And  um  while I was working on designing the website I talked to several other people including the public relations chair about how to design and present ourselves on the website.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
And  we disagreed about certain  uh  about the layout and things like that.,0.3182,0.272,0.592,0.136,pp13
So to resolve the issue  we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to  we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people.,0.8307,0.215,0.785,0.0,pp13
And  we also got opinions from several other team members.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
Um  one thing right now is that  I get hung up on small details on a project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
And  that could be an issue when I'm working on a big project  it can take too much time to focus on little things that don't matter too much in the big picture.,-0.0191,0.0,0.968,0.032,pp13
But  I'm working on changing that so since I've come to MIT I've been involved in a lot of activities and a lot of classes  and this is forcing me to manage my time well so I've gotten better at focusing on the big picture of the project rather than small details that don't matter very much.,0.7773,0.111,0.871,0.018,pp13
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp13
I have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done  and  I'm really interested in this position and I think I can learn and grow from it.,0.2716,0.135,0.789,0.076,pp13
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp13
So  please tell me more about your background.,0.3804,0.27,0.73,0.0,pp14
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
I'm a computer science student here and I'm currently a junior  but I'm planning on graduating early.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
So  uhm  I'm right now looking into either getting my master's degree or looking at full time jobs as well and balancing that.,0.2732,0.087,0.913,0.0,pp14
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Uh  in terms of what I enjoy in computer science  I really like front end stuff.,0.7178,0.3,0.7,0.0,pp14
I've done a lot of web development.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
I worked at Google last Summer  Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
On Google+ photos  the front end for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
And  uh  yeah.,0.296,0.524,0.476,0.0,pp14
So I really like  eh  c-consumer facing products.,0.469,0.304,0.696,0.0,pp14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Uh  well  I think I have a pretty engaging personality.,0.7717,0.524,0.476,0.0,pp14
So I'm very expressive and I'm good at communicating things.,0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,pp14
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
So I think  y'know  just that qualification in itself really lends m- my  uh  myself to leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
But I think also  uh  as a technical person it's  it's e- especially useful to have those skills because they are more rare.,0.6474,0.163,0.837,0.0,pp14
So in that sense I do think I'm a leader  because I possess both  you know  technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well.,0.5709,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp14
So the pairing of that really does lend itself well to leadership roles.,0.2732,0.149,0.851,0.0,pp14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
And do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.109,0.795,0.096,pp14
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
So  eh  what's so great about MIT is that we actually do a lot of group projects that really encourage teamwork.,0.87,0.317,0.683,0.0,pp14
So  you know  a lot of the issues that maybe I didn't work out in high school  in terms of working on a team  I've gotten the chance to flesh out here and I do think that I've been able to grow  uhm  as someone working on a team.,0.25,0.04,0.96,0.0,pp14
So for example  in one of my classes  it's a software design class  and we basically had to split up the work so that we could get this huge project done.,0.3869,0.08,0.92,0.0,pp14
And one of the people on my team was just really not pulling her weight.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
And so me and this other person noticed this and we were concerned.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
But we all discussed it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
We sat down and discussed it and we realized just that the way we were allocating the work wasn't playing to her strengths.,0.2751,0.107,0.83,0.063,pp14
Mmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
So we adjusted how we were allocating the work and then things worked out a lot better.,0.4404,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp14
We were able to  you know  accomplish our goals and also more evenly divide the- the work.,0.4215,0.149,0.851,0.0,pp14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
And if you were given an option to change on thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Uhm  that's a hard question.,-0.1027,0.0,0.741,0.259,pp14
Haha!,0.5093,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Haha!,0.5093,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Cuz I'm a pretty confident person so there's not a lot of things.,0.7506,0.368,0.632,0.0,pp14
I don't often think about this.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
I guess... ... I wish that  uhm... ... I wish I had the ability to  uh  I guess stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more.,0.8271,0.311,0.627,0.063,pp14
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
I think because I am very ambitious and I really enjoy life  I'm always going and moving and doing things  and I think there's times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatever's happening in your life.,0.9421,0.318,0.682,0.0,pp14
Uh  but  you know  I'm young  so I like to try a lot of new things.,0.5672,0.196,0.804,0.0,pp14
And that's a consequence of that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
And last question:  Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
Uh  so I mentioned this before  but I think I'm qualified in a lot of respects  both technically and in my communication skills.,0.4497,0.118,0.882,0.0,pp14
So that's just a balance that you don't see a lot  uh  especially in the computer science field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
So I think I can bring a lot to the table in terms of that  uh  in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people  but also my ability to understand  uh  technical concepts.,0.5574,0.113,0.887,0.0,pp14
And especially working in a technical company that's incredibly important.,0.2716,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp14
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp14
So I think I have a good balance of that and you're not going to find a lot of candidates like that.,0.6597,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp14
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp14
Please tell me more about your background.,0.3182,0.277,0.723,0.0,pp15
More about my background?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Uh are we assuming that-- I haven't done that yet.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Um all right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um  so I guess I'll start out with uh I decided to go to MIT as my undergrad school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Because I wanted a strong education in science and math.,0.5106,0.268,0.732,0.0,pp15
And um MIT I found would be one of the best places to develop my problem-solving skills and my uh quant--my quantitative skills  which is really valuable  I feel um for employers nowadays  and so I can certainly say that [laugh] it's I have definitely got a lot better at  like  learning how to solve problems working with others  um and it's also given me like a lot of opportunity  MIT has given me a lot of opportunity to  you know  test out my leadership skills by having so many different student groups.,0.9802,0.276,0.701,0.023,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um in particular um  I've like  I feel that um my position as the 2014 treasurer my freshman year was uh really critical in helping me develop um  you know  time management skills  interpersonal skills-- Mm-hm.,0.4349,0.157,0.779,0.063,pp15
--and communicating with like not only your like not only with like um people who are at  you know  adults who are older than you  and working with people in different offices  but also with  like  your peers.,0.4386,0.119,0.807,0.074,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um similarly  um in training students club  I've found um that where I've taken a leadership role as a cultural chair that  unlike in say  high school  you need to really spearhead um efforts to like throw large events yourself  and that's like it's really given me um a feel of what it's like to sort of  you know  take on the responsibility of like organizing an event.,0.8402,0.135,0.865,0.0,pp15
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um  I think I def-- um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
I'm sorry.,-0.0772,0.0,0.435,0.565,pp15
I think that I am definitely a leader.,0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0,pp15
As I've  I've shared with you previously  I um have taken um positions with great responsibility in the student groups I'm involved in  and as well in my major  I uh am I am inv-- uh  I'm in biological engineering  and I think that I've taken a lot of initiative in finding  you know  ways to like test out the concepts I learn in class outside of class by finding uh research positions and later lab um where the weekly lab meetings has really helped me  you know  improve my communication skills with presenting information to an audience.,0.9186,0.131,0.869,0.0,pp15
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
And can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team  and you had to solve it.,-0.128,0.072,0.837,0.092,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Um I think probably the best example um I definitely consider myself a team player.,0.7845,0.347,0.653,0.0,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
I had to work in teams--in everything I've had to do so far  from academics to my work experience.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um in my start-up internship my freshman year um and my corporate internship my sophomore year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um everything was I had to learn how to um not only do the task that was given to me  but to also sort of be able to  you know  delegate tasks to who I was working with and carry out what was  what was asked of me  as well.,0.3919,0.051,0.949,0.0,pp15
Um last summer  I was a year  um I did an international year off in Thailand  and my lab partner um was a graduate student who was older than me  but I was  we were partners on the project-- Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
--but we found that our levels of technical skill were really different.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
It was her first time working in any sort of lab-- Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
--whereas I was more experienced.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
So  that sort of created a strange dynamic between us  um because I had to  like  take the lead even though she was given more responsibility because more was expected from her  so I had to sort of help her out and get her up to speed with  with the project.,0.7517,0.162,0.807,0.032,pp15
Um  and I needed to do that in a way that didn't hurt our personal relationship-- Hmm.,0.4168,0.148,0.852,0.0,pp15
--because we also did have to  like  live together.,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Being Americans abroad  we really stayed together for most of it  so I felt that being just like really honest and transparent with her was um the best way um just to like say  what about you know say  you know  just like speak up about our frustrations  but also like to  to compliment on  like  the things that are done well.,0.9609,0.303,0.671,0.026,pp15
I think that's what really helped.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um so  one thing I wish I was better at was um you know speaking well when put on the spot.,0.7717,0.3,0.7,0.0,pp15
[Laugh] I tend to  when I'm nervous  I tend to  you know  not really focus on what I'm saying  because I'm trying not to mess up-- Mm-hm.,0.5588,0.18,0.754,0.066,pp15
--and in order to hide that  I also  you know  channel the stress in different ways  such as like looking around  perhaps a lot of intrusive movement with my hands or my body  um and also speaking  being long-winded and speaking too much in order to cover that up.,-0.25,0.047,0.868,0.085,pp15
So  I think that just being more comfortable with speaking um in the higher pressure situation  such as public speaking  or in an interview!,0.3989,0.138,0.783,0.078,pp15
[Laughs] [Laughs] Um is something that I would like to improve.,0.8957,0.628,0.372,0.0,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
And  last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
Um so I think that I can bring like with the the my skills and experience is um someone who is really can work well under stress.,0.2648,0.154,0.758,0.088,pp15
I may not talk well under stress-- [laughs] [Laughs] --but I can work well under stress.,-0.3087,0.253,0.439,0.308,pp15
Um I think my academic being um you know having the rigorous undergraduate curriculum at MIT has made me really hone my time management skills.,-0.2732,0.0,0.92,0.08,pp15
Um the other week I had to juggle um um  you know  throwing together a large event for a student's club  um and have meetings with cultural chairs of the other clubs.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um I've also had to  at the same time there was a big event that my sorority was organizing that I also have to help contribute to.,0.4019,0.094,0.906,0.0,pp15
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
And  like  uh my  I had a friend who's also going through a tough time  so I had to  like  help her out.,0.8555,0.359,0.592,0.049,pp15
That  and then complete school work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
And also  um  you know  just keep on the lookout  now that I'm a junior  there's a lot of like  you know  opportunities and needs  such as like fellowships  and then  like  programs of like IP  over the summer  that have  like  application deadlines coming up-- Mm-hm.,0.9201,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp15
--and just being able to balance all of that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp15
Um and so far um I think that  like  my experiences um that I was able to be on top of all of those deadlines.,0.5106,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp15
Not only now  but  like  in the past  and I think that says a lot about um my ability to  you know  work hard and also  you know  balance out my lifestyle.,0.6808,0.168,0.788,0.043,pp15
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp15
So um I think that this would be a huge asset at your company.,0.5859,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp15
Please tell me a little bit more about your background.,0.3182,0.204,0.796,0.0,pp16
Umm  so I'm a Junior at MIT  umm studying economics  umm and planning on minoring in biology  perhaps concentrating in anthropology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Umm  I'm interested in pursuing a degree in Public Health after  right after MIT  umm and either waiting to do an MD  or combining those two at the same time.,0.4019,0.085,0.915,0.0,pp16
Umm  what I'm really interested is health care disparities  umm especially in  in the field of international health  umm specifically kind of doing uh cost evaluation of different health projects  umm working towards  uh figuring out how resources can best be allocated  and best be used to maximize efficiency.,0.9524,0.28,0.72,0.0,pp16
Umm  and then here at MIT I'm also involved in an organization called Glommid  umm and we  what we do is we're partnered with an organization in Togo  umm and they work with HIV/AIDS patients there and they are the primary HIV/AID care provider  umm  outside of the public health system there.,0.4939,0.059,0.941,0.0,pp16
Umm  and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year and then in the summer we go and implement a project there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Oh  ok great.,0.743,0.863,0.137,0.0,pp16
And do you think you are a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Tell me more.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Umm  I think that definitely over the MIT  my MIT career  I've evolved more as a leader.,0.4019,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp16
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Umm  of the  umm actually the co-president of Glommid  umm last year  so the club started last year  uh  but the presidents were not very invested in the club  umm  and what I learned from that was I guess  the experience was  taught me some things what leaders shouldn't be  but I think really I've learned whats effective as a leader so far  by doing things differently this semester.,0.631,0.058,0.942,0.0,pp16
Um  some of the things like even just the really little basic things seem to really have an impact  so for example  for our staff meetings which is the whole general body meeting  umm we're sending  we send out a little doodle form beforehand and it kinda just has  you know what concerns do you have  umm do you feel like you're really involved  like umm  and there's also just a little section  like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week.,0.9445,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp16
And just having that  like interaction and then also we like follow up on any concerns  umm I think the members really have liked that  and so far compared to last year everyone like even the people who are just general body members not even like an exec are much more invested than some of the exec members last year and I think thats because we realized last year what we really were lacking  umm  like my current co-president realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project  we need to focus within ourselves first.,0.9635,0.163,0.822,0.015,pp16
Umm  so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership.,0.4522,0.212,0.788,0.0,pp16
Great  ok.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp16
Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of when there was a conflict within your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.082,0.846,0.072,pp16
Umm  yea ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
So  conflict.,-0.3804,0.0,0.278,0.722,pp16
Umm  well i guess I'll use an example from last year for Glommid.,0.2732,0.149,0.851,0.0,pp16
Umm  so we were partnered with a different organization last year  and we  what  how it works is a national organization  theres fifty chapters  umm and we had a partner in Laos  and all of a sudden last minute  they said we could no longer go and implement the project.,-0.296,0.0,0.957,0.043,pp16
So I was the person in charge of organizing the trip  that my role on exec  so that was really hard for me because I felt kind of betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals umm  because the reason was because the Laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their NGO status revoked since Laos just started having NGO's.,-0.7172,0.0,0.913,0.087,pp16
So that was something I kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here  like Laos is very not welcoming towards Americans because of  past.,0.385,0.203,0.667,0.13,pp16
And so  I felt really kind of let down by umm  by them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
And I think everyone on the Glommid team also felt really let down  because it was February  we had been fundraising all year  planning campaigns  umm and this  so what we did I think  umm  like I switched over to campaigns coordinator and I still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them  because it wasn't because they were a bad organization that we couldn't go  it was because that the government wouldn't allow it  and we didn't want to risk them losing their NGO status for a project.,0.0583,0.086,0.83,0.084,pp16
Umm  so what  I  went through the campaign  I tried to get people to focus more  just remember what our partner does  why we are doing this  umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Umm  and then through this summer  and through this fall i've been trying to keep in contact with our partner  our old partner  although we are repartnered now  umm  to see how our  the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about what's going on  so that it doesn't feel like last year was a complete failure.,-0.4423,0.035,0.888,0.076,pp16
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Yea.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp16
And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Oh  thats a tough question.,-0.128,0.0,0.727,0.273,pp16
Umm  I think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings.,0.25,0.177,0.699,0.124,pp16
Umm  and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation  so I think  I've definitely  and this is something i've been working on to be more proactive and in larger group situations  but for example like big lectures  asking questions or things like that I usually try and avoid  but I've been trying to push myself to become more vocal.,0.8292,0.169,0.794,0.038,pp16
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp16
And last question  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Uh  I think I should get the job because I think what my assets are I combine Econ and health  which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination.,0.1779,0.049,0.951,0.0,pp16
And I've done  I've taken a lot of classes  I'm involved in a national development  both from the technical side of Econ  the anthropological and the health side.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
And also my involvement in Glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that I don't think necessarily come through a class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp16
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp16
How have you been?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Been all right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
School’s uh  you know  it’s always that time in the middle of the semester.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Yeah it’s nuts.,-0.0258,0.4,0.182,0.418,pp17
All right so can you tell me a little bit more about your background Um yes so I am a junior here at MIT in Computer Science and Engineering um and most of my experience here has been actually at the Game Lab on campus so I’ve worked there for the past few years and I’ve worked on many different kinds of projects in various languages and with different people.,0.4019,0.038,0.962,0.0,pp17
Um and uh also uh I’ve taken courses here in algorithms  uh in graphics  uh also software construction.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
But I’ve really found algorithms to be something that I’m really interested in  I think they’re really beautiful and elegant  they can accomplish a lot.,0.9639,0.462,0.538,0.0,pp17
And in my spare time I like to um do yoga  I’m not very good at it  and I love food so finding hidden gems in the city is really fun.,0.8258,0.258,0.676,0.066,pp17
Great and do you think you’re a leader?,0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0,pp17
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Uh yes I am.,0.4019,0.474,0.526,0.0,pp17
So um last semester here at MIT I took  as I mentioned  a software construction class and um in this class we had you know quite a few projects and some of these were group projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
So the first group project that we had in the class  um I was working with uh two of my peers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
They seemed um like nice people and all but we were having issues um you know actually getting things done.,0.3919,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp17
Getting a time when we could all meet and um you know that sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
So uh it looked like no one was really stepping up so I decided to step up and um I made sure to contact everyone in the group and um you know got us working together um and we met up.,0.3818,0.107,0.844,0.049,pp17
And you know I made sure that we were always on task and took notes on what we were doing um so that when it came to actually implementing our ideas that we actually had some sort of structure and our project turned out really great uh at the end.,0.7713,0.122,0.878,0.0,pp17
There was a bit of a time crunch but all in all I think we worked together really well and I’m very pleased with how it turned out.,0.8115,0.221,0.779,0.0,pp17
Great okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp17
Do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.084,0.841,0.074,pp17
I do consider myself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Um worked on many teams.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
So in this same software construction class ironically the second group project which was our final project for the course did not go quite as planned.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
So I was working with two other people and uh in this case I tried to get us working together and tried to do my part for our project but uh they were not having it and um they actually ended up overwriting my code multiple times instead of you know allowing me to contribute to the project um even after I spoke to them about it and told them there were tools um that could help resolve conflicts in the code and they just weren’t cooperating.,0.5499,0.074,0.89,0.036,pp17
Um and so I ended up having to go talk to my TA and talking to my course administrator here and also to the student support services to see you know what  how I could resolves the situation because I had done everything that I thought I could.,0.5267,0.087,0.913,0.0,pp17
Um so that turned out okay at the end but sometimes things are out of your control and I think those are the hardest problems to confront but um you know uh it’s okay to ask for help sometimes I think that it ended up okay in the end.,0.4767,0.166,0.738,0.096,pp17
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp17
Um if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Ooh  that’s a toughie.,-0.1779,0.0,0.638,0.362,pp17
Hmm I think  if I had one thing I could change it would probably be being more aggressive  which aggressive is a scary word perhaps so um perhaps being more assertive.,-0.7146,0.0,0.801,0.199,pp17
I’ve always been a pretty quiet person um even when I was growing up and this is something that like in elementary school my teachers would say that  “Oh” you know on my progress reports  “[Stephie?],0.8481,0.242,0.758,0.0,pp17
Is a very quiet and sweet girl” but they didn’t really have anything else to say because I was so quiet.,0.2805,0.096,0.904,0.0,pp17
Um and you know even now sometimes being around people can make me nervous and this is something that I’ve been working on um you know over you know since I can remember I guess.,-0.2732,0.0,0.942,0.058,pp17
And as of late I’ve been trying to take a more active role in you know overcoming my fear of people.,-0.0534,0.119,0.754,0.127,pp17
Uh I uh a few years ago worked at a Starbucks for about a year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Yeah back in  this was in downtown Boston in the financial district  so of all the customers you could possibly have at a Starbucks  these were the probably the most challenging ones that you could have.,0.4754,0.107,0.893,0.0,pp17
So after working there and dealing with these people I feel like I can pretty much you know  I can deal with anyone even if it makes me sort of nervous.,0.5118,0.158,0.776,0.066,pp17
Um you know I’ve been there so I can sort of take my experiences form there and apply them to what I encounter nowadays.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Great okay last question.,0.7184,0.75,0.25,0.0,pp17
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Hm  well uh I have a lot of experience uh working at the Game Lab here and that coupled with you know what I’ve learned in classes I think makes me a really good fit for this job.,0.7947,0.187,0.813,0.0,pp17
I have  um so when I was working at the Game Lab I worked on many  many projects so pretty much one project a semester and these projects varied widely.,0.6269,0.124,0.876,0.0,pp17
They were in different languages  the topics were different.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Some were more technical  some weren’t’.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Some were more fully specified than others.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
And so given that I’ve touched upon such a wide range of things  I think that I’m very adaptable.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp17
Uh and also um at this Game Lab  I’ve worked in lots of teams  so I feel like I have a strong grasp of teamwork and having worked at that Starbucks  I’ve really learned to deal with all sorts of people so I feel like that’s a good asset to have for this job.,0.9221,0.225,0.775,0.0,pp17
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp17
Tell me a little more about your life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
OK  um... this is separate from the other time  right?,0.4466,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp20
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp20
OK (laughs)  um  I'm a junior  um  at MIT studying environmental engineering.,0.7297,0.38,0.62,0.0,pp20
Um  I'm originally from Minnesota.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology and environmental transport and I found them really interesting.,0.4576,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp20
Great And I thought that they would apply to this job.,0.6249,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp20
Mmmmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,pp20
(Laughs) Great.,0.8074,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp20
So  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  yeah  I think I've stepped up to a lot of leaderslip  -ship positions since I came to college.,0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,pp20
I'm president of my living group  um   I'm also on the rowing team and I feel like I've  um  played a leadership role there  um... OK.,0.5994,0.17,0.83,0.0,pp20
Could you be a little bit more specific?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  so  as president of my living group  um  I lead house meetings every other week  Oh  OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
and I also am involved in resolving problems between people  um  so there's like several different conditions in the house which control  like  say for instance  like  buying food  or like  maintaining the house and I help coordinate everybody and make sure they can work together.,0.9213,0.305,0.649,0.046,pp20
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Mmmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
And can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.097,0.818,0.086,pp20
Umm... yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,pp20
Umm  let me think.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
I guess something that's come up in my living group  I was house manager last semester  and so  as part of our living group  people have to do  like  weekly house jobs... Mmmhmm So like  kind of chores  and so we've definitely had conflicts over  like  people who aren't pulling their weight in the house  and there were times I had to step in and take the person aside and let them know that they were adversely affecting the group and that there were  like  consequences if they didn't  um   end up  you know  pulling more weight  and I definitely had success with that and  um  one particular instance I talked to someone and she came back to the next house meeting and apologized to the group  and... Oh ... definitely started to change her behavior.,0.9624,0.163,0.809,0.028,pp20
Oh  that's great.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,pp20
Ok  so  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.296,0.115,0.885,0.0,pp20
Um... I don't... I don't think there's anything I would necessarily change about myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
I feel like the experiences I've had have  like  taught me different things... Mmmhmm.,0.6124,0.294,0.706,0.0,pp20
And  um  there's definitely things I'm working on growing in... OK.,0.5267,0.328,0.672,0.0,pp20
But they're things that  like  I don't think they're things I would expect to change overnight  necessarily.,0.5023,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp20
Mmmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Can you give me an idea of what those are?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  I'm working on being more outgoing  so  like I said  I've stepped up  both on the crew team and as part of my living group... Mmmhmm.,0.7239,0.195,0.805,0.0,pp20
... into leadership roles  and so I think that's changed a lot in the last couple of years and is still changing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp20
And... why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  I think I have a lot of experience  um  with the classes I've taken and with previous internship opportunities.,0.3818,0.12,0.88,0.0,pp20
Um  I did an internship at an environment restoration company after my freshman year... Mmmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
..which I think helped prepare me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp20
Um  I'm also really excited about going into this field  um  I haven't  b-  had the chance to apply the things I've learned in my classes yet and I think this would be a really good opportunity for me to apply those things  so... I think I would be able to help the company out in that way.,0.9129,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp20
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp20
So uh please tell me a little more about your background.,0.3774,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp21
Okay!So uh I grew up in Tampa  Florida uhm from paretns of Chinese-American decent or they're from China and I'm Chinese American and uhm thoughout my uhm high school career I actually uh taking biology classes cuz I had a really good teacher who like really made uh this subject material engaging uhm and then here in MIT I uhm I first started out as Course 20 which us uh biological engineering and then I took my first programming class and I really liked it  its like uhm I think it sort of matches uhm how I think like telling a computer how to uh do things in a precise way and so thats why I switched to uh Course 67. oh ok.,0.938,0.123,0.877,0.0,pp21
hmmm mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp21
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp21
Tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp21
uhm I think that I'm a leader in the sense that like oh let's say that there's a thing that needs to get done then I will make sure that it does get done like uh for example at uh the TAC which is MIT student newspaper uhm every week uhm you have to uh of course like edit things and when the previous uhm campus life editor wanted to move on to a different department I stepped up and got it done uhm yeah.,0.875,0.13,0.87,0.0,pp21
okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp21
Do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and how you resolved it?,-0.1531,0.055,0.871,0.074,pp21
uhm so I guess when uhm I havent had a super large amount of time to uh experience doing like really large team projects I imagine I'll get more experience in that as I get into like more project based classes uhm I guess I would uh I'm okay with working with other people as long as uh there's like clear communication and like people are responsible like uhm doing the task that they're supposed to be doing.,0.921,0.211,0.755,0.034,pp21
I guess I would be good working with a team other like responsible people that make sure like you're doing your portion of the job because I would want to make sure I am also doing my portion of the job and like if everybody like does their part then I think that I would be happy working with them.,0.9674,0.332,0.668,0.0,pp21
Good!And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp21
hmmm well actually statistically I think that I would like to be a little but taller because actually it's true I believe that like taller people are more like uhm they get better like jobs and like they're statistically more likely to succeed just because you're more impressed by a taller person so it's like well sure why not?,0.9919,0.485,0.515,0.0,pp21
It would I think it would make it might have some percentage chance of making my life better.,0.5994,0.234,0.766,0.0,pp21
Also if I maybe there's like another second thing changing my last name to something that starts with A because thats also showing statistically increase your chances of success.,0.8519,0.292,0.708,0.0,pp21
okay!,0.2942,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp21
And last question  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp21
uhm same company okay uhm so I think I hope that uh I have so I would obviously really love working for Google and I would and uhm my skills as being responsible  communicating clearly  my uh computer science skills I learned at MIT I hope will bring uh a lot of value to this position and I also really uh would I hope to embody Google's principles of like uh making really innovative software and like to build to delivering really good customer experiences uhm and I hope that uh they will uh I hope you will also find my contributions you can find my uh contributions useful.,0.9903,0.312,0.688,0.0,pp21
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp21
Tell me a little bit about you  okay?,0.2263,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp22
I'm a Junior in Aerospace Engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
I'm originally from Kansas City  born in Maryland.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And I'm interested in consulting because I'm currently trying to decide between going into Aerospace Engineering and going into consulting.,0.4019,0.124,0.876,0.0,pp22
And one of the things that appeals to me about consulting is that I like the idea of working on different projects and not being stuck doing the same thing all the time and that's something that is very prevalent in engineering and is very traditional about the engineering field.,0.5007,0.081,0.919,0.0,pp22
And  as far as hobbies that I enjoy I am interested in global development  international development and poverty related issues as well as music.,0.5719,0.256,0.639,0.105,pp22
I play cello and am involved with the chamber music society at MIT.,0.34,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp22
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp22
So  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
Yes  I definitely do think I'm a leader.,0.6597,0.474,0.526,0.0,pp22
Um  one of the global poverty - er - one of the organizations I'm involved with on campus is the Global Poverty Initiative and I'm currently their Director of Action.,-0.765,0.0,0.809,0.191,pp22
And what that means is I'm leading a student group of about twenty people and - um - under the Action branch of the whole organization - and what we do is - in the Action branch - is work on projects on a global scale.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
So  we have projects currently in India and projects in mexico.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And my job is to coordinate these projects and work on what communities we want to go work in and what types of technology related projects we'd like to pursue.,0.4215,0.119,0.881,0.0,pp22
And I've been involved with this organization for two and a half years now  and have been the director of Action for the past two years.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
Well okay.,0.4588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp22
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp22
Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.079,0.851,0.07,pp22
I definitely do consider myself a team player.,0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0,pp22
Um  one time that we experienced some conflict in one of the teams I was working on was actually in one of my Aerospace Engineering classes.,-0.3182,0.0,0.916,0.084,pp22
In this team  our job was to build an RC airplane - design  build and fly it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And we hit some conflicts within our team because - it was mostly everyone was very busy  everyone was very stressed.,-0.6478,0.0,0.782,0.218,pp22
It was towards the end of the year when everyone's preparing for finals and it was just a very high-strung environment  and the projects was very involved.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
It involved machining  it involved design work  and coordination between a team of four.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And what ended up happening was  well  we needed to get in and find the time to actually work on our airplane and build it.,0.2732,0.08,0.92,0.0,pp22
Whereas all of us were involved in student groups and had a very heavy courseload.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And conflict did arise.,-0.3182,0.0,0.566,0.434,pp22
And how we ended up solving this was we - we all decided that something needed to change.,0.34,0.124,0.876,0.0,pp22
And we realized that we weren't putting together quality work when we were doing two people at a time or two people coming in or someone cancelling at the last minute - things like that.,0.1779,0.067,0.885,0.048,pp22
We ended up just having to sit down  lay it all out  discuss whatever we needed to do to make sure that we're all here - we're all committing the right amount of time towards this project.,0.3818,0.093,0.907,0.0,pp22
And  honestly it was just very much a group effort and we all sat down and individually realized that we needed to prioritize.,0.4588,0.12,0.88,0.0,pp22
And I needed to put my classes above some of my interests and my hobbies.,0.25,0.125,0.875,0.0,pp22
And that was something that we all decided to do as a group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp22
Um  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
One thing about myself... being more on top of my work.,0.2682,0.172,0.828,0.0,pp22
Something that I definitely need for myself is a deadline and I've always been like that.,0.6369,0.271,0.729,0.0,pp22
If you don't give me a deadline sometimes I'll end up dragging my feet  and things get done at the last minute and it's just... disorganization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And so I've been trying to deal with that by making my own small deadlines - personal deadlines - writing them down  making lists and making sure that I prioritize things in advance.,0.3182,0.067,0.933,0.0,pp22
But that's something that has taken me probably two years at MIT to learn how to do - and I'm finally getting it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp22
Okay  and why do you think should get the job?,0.2263,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp22
I think I should get the job because I have a very interesting background  and I believe that I have very unique experiences that could add a lot to your organization.,0.4576,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp22
As someone with an engineering background but - as well as a management background because I am minoring in management at MIT.,0.3919,0.112,0.888,0.0,pp22
And I think that combination adds a lot to the environment that you would like to have at your company.,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,pp22
I think putting a lot of people together in one environment trying to work on the same projects with the same background is something that is very limiting.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
And I believe that I could add quite a bit of diversity and unique perspective to your team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp22
Can you tell me a little bit more about your background?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
Sure  so I'm currently a junior at MIT.,0.3182,0.247,0.753,0.0,pp24
I grew up outside of the city in a suburb called Naydec.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
I've danced my whole life and continued to do so at MIT and I'm studying biology currently and for my humanities concentration  concentrating on Spanish.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
Oh  great!,0.6588,0.815,0.185,0.0,pp24
So do you think you are a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
I would say definitely in various aspects of my life I try to step up as a leader.,0.4019,0.137,0.863,0.0,pp24
I'm currently involved in an internship through HELLO at MIT and so the point of the internship is to act as a peer network engagement intern.,0.4588,0.107,0.893,0.0,pp24
So basically  reaching out to other Jewish students at MIT  who may not be looking for a very religious atmosphere.,0.2682,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp24
But would just like to know that there are other Jewish students that they could connect with.,0.5023,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp24
And so my role as the leader of the situation is to connect various students who have similar interests either in community service or things like that and sort of set up a network for them.,0.5423,0.117,0.883,0.0,pp24
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp24
So do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
And can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.097,0.818,0.086,pp24
Sure  I definitely hope that I'm a team player.,0.7845,0.568,0.432,0.0,pp24
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp24
I think.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
It's definitely important to have leadership qualities but also to be able to mesh well within a group.,0.5994,0.282,0.718,0.0,pp24
I think this comes out a lot in lab settings where everyone from undergraduate students to PhD candidates and post Docs really have to work together on similar projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
And so being able to voice your opinions or your concerns about experiments while still taking the feedback from others  and making it more of a group effort than a hierarchy  I would say would be crucial.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp24
So if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
I think  if I could change one thing it would probably be to have a little bit more self confidence.,0.5542,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp24
I think I externally try to project a calm and outgoing personality  but inside I can tend to be a little bit shyer.,0.1198,0.13,0.799,0.071,pp24
And so I think just being able to walk into any kind of either social or business related situation and really have that confidence without having to second guess myself would help move along both career wise and just with relationships with other people.,0.8542,0.186,0.814,0.0,pp24
And last question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
I think coming with a background from MIT would definitely help me out in this job.,0.6597,0.278,0.722,0.0,pp24
The biology department at MIT is really unique in its focus on research.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp24
And so I think coming into this lab setting with that background would make a strong candidate.,0.5106,0.171,0.829,0.0,pp24
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp25
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp25
Can you tell me some more about your background?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,pp25
I am  wait sorry  am I .. [crosstalk] Ok  um I'm Kathleen  I'm a Core 16 major here at MITU  that's um aeronautical and astronautical engineering  if you're not familiar with our numbering system.,0.2263,0.062,0.901,0.037,pp25
Um  so I've been taking a lot of classes in aeronautical and astronautical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Including some um propulsion classes  um uh principals of automatic control  um dynamics  aerodynamics  um computer engineering  so I am familiar with job and mat lab  Um  and then also within those classes I've done some lab work.,0.2732,0.054,0.946,0.0,pp25
Um  including work on um a remote control airplane.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  which we did for a competition last spring.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  it was in teams of three.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  my team  and the the goal is to maximize the ratio of the um the turn rate times the pay turn rate squared times the pay load.,-0.2023,0.0,0.903,0.097,pp25
Mmm Hmm Um  my team worked really hard on that um and uh we ended up coming in second  um.,-0.1761,0.0,0.918,0.082,pp25
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp25
Which was exciting  a little bit disappointing but [laughter] still it was still a really fun project that we worked on.,0.8841,0.373,0.562,0.065,pp25
Um  and then also done internships with  um my most recent one was with NASA Glenn Research Center  um and I worked on two projects for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  one was a Venus rover conceptual design.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  which was where we were trying to basically just figure out what the fees-ability would be for a small low cost rover on Venus  um that would be able to fit within the budget of a discovery class mission.,0.1027,0.059,0.892,0.049,pp25
Um  and then  so that one was mostly  um there was a lot of research  a lot of um  pulling the other information from different areas  kind of because it's not really a thing that people have looked at very closely before.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
There's not a lot of information on the topic of how things perform in uh 450 degrees C in 90 atmospheres of pressure.,-0.296,0.0,0.909,0.091,pp25
It's kind of a specific thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Mmm hmm Um  so it was um a lot of just like trying to figure out  like what would work  what wouldn't work.,0.6124,0.192,0.808,0.0,pp25
Um  a lot of flexibility in the designs since it was in early stages  um and a lot of  um there's some  some mat lab you know and analysis and um coding involved with that to.,0.34,0.064,0.936,0.0,pp25
Um  then the second project that we worked on for that internship was um an autonomous navigation system for small payloads um and that was an intern team project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
There was totally designed and run by me and a group of seven other interns.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  so that was outside of work hours.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
We were putting together  um it was uh steerable [inaudible] parachute.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Mmm hmm Um  attached to a payload of about two or three pounds  um and I was in charge of testing and designing the  the parachute for that  um so that was  that was the second main project that we worked on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp25
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp25
You think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  yes I do think I'm a leader.,0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0,pp25
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp25
Um  and I think that I've shown that through my work on my projects.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  being willing to  to make decisions  take chances with something um that may or may not work  but it's wi ...  it's important to be able to try things to figure out if that's gonna be the case or not.,0.3818,0.085,0.915,0.0,pp25
Mmm hmm Um and I think that  uh especially like in the  the Venus rover and um also with the dropson project  um since those were two projects where there weren't a lot of uh specific design constraints imposed on us from the start  Mmm hmm It was really important to just  um to just take an idea and run with it.,0.5553,0.075,0.905,0.02,pp25
Run the equations  um drop it off a building  in the case of the dropson  [laughter] um and just see what happened  um.,0.2732,0.122,0.798,0.08,pp25
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
So that was something that I got to be pretty comfortable with doing.,0.7579,0.371,0.629,0.0,pp25
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp25
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Can you give me an example where you had a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp25
Uh  yes and yes.,0.6597,0.73,0.27,0.0,pp25
[laughter] Um  I need a  so especially with the intern team project  when there were eight of us involved in this team  um and that was a kind of unique experience in that there was really no like hierarchy of um control or anything it was just eight interns and we were all on equal footing.,0.2743,0.075,0.885,0.04,pp25
All had pretty equal experience and backgrounds  um so there wasn't really anyone who was specifically in charge of that project  um and that involved a lot of give and take.,0.4939,0.096,0.904,0.0,pp25
Um and so  I think one of the biggest uh conflicts we faced as a team was when we were just deciding  at the very beginning what our project was going to be.,-0.3818,0.0,0.925,0.075,pp25
Mmm hmm Um and this was going to be something that was gonna uh be a pretty significant part of the next ten weeks of our summer.,0.6124,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp25
So it was pretty important for us to choose something that was gonna  was gonna go well.,0.7479,0.345,0.655,0.0,pp25
Um  so the it ended up being a uh fairly difficult decision between the uh a design project for uh a small re-entry vehicle versus the autonomous navigation system that we did.,-0.3612,0.0,0.925,0.075,pp25
Um  and how we handled it um was we just kind of  we all came together and had um a round table sort of a discussion.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um  we implemented hand raising uh rules Mmm hmm and um so as to make sure that people had equal talking time.,0.6705,0.216,0.784,0.0,pp25
Um  and then we  after we had talked for several hours  um making sure that most of the important things that needed to be said would get said  Mmm hmm Um we  we just voted on it um with secret ballet  wrote down what our decision  what decision we wanted  um we counted up the votes and then we just went with that decision.,0.5209,0.066,0.934,0.0,pp25
Um and I think that um  for me and for the other interns on the team as well  it was really important that everyone recognize that whatever the outcome of the vote was  was that's what we were gonna do um and we would all get on board with that project right away.,0.4927,0.076,0.924,0.0,pp25
Um and that's what happened  um and there wasn't any like uh  real I don't know bitterness or resentment about doing the project that we did.,-0.4122,0.075,0.76,0.166,pp25
I think it pretty well.,0.6486,0.639,0.361,0.0,pp25
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp25
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um I would make it so that I was more organized.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
I often struggle to meet deadlines  when I have a lot of them piled together.,-0.3182,0.0,0.859,0.141,pp25
Not because the work is hard  but because I just forget that the deadlines are coming.,-0.3716,0.0,0.798,0.202,pp25
Mmm Hmm Um  so I think that that's something that I could really work on um and I have been working on that [laughter] um by keeping notebooks and writing down uh schedules of important dates  um asking friends to help me out if I know that there's something we're working on together and it's at the deadline or just an assignment that we both have and there's a deadline.,0.8689,0.141,0.859,0.0,pp25
Asking for a reminder um from my more talented friends  um and keeping my Google calendar up to date as well has been helping with that.,0.8826,0.339,0.661,0.0,pp25
Great and why do you think you should get the job?,0.6249,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp25
Um I think I should get this job because I am uh I am well qualified for it.,0.2732,0.11,0.89,0.0,pp25
I've done projects that are um  they are in the same type of area and I think that my experiences from them will really carry over so I can contribute to this job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp25
Um and uh I think that I can also  um I mean I've also shown that I'm  I am a team player and a leader so I think that as well as my technical expertise  I think that uh my personality fits in well with this job and I really like the environment as well that I've seen.,0.796,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp25
Um um um  employees it seems like there's a lot of enthusiasm for work Intrviewer: Mmm Hmm um and I think that I would fit in well with that.,0.8402,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp25
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I'm doing well  thank you.,0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,pp27
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp27
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
Um so I'm a jun--wait...sorry  I don't-- I'm sorry i just  uh I'm just confused about  like  are we--are we going like the same thing last time or do I need to introduce myself again?,0.4445,0.157,0.784,0.058,pp27
...like... Yea  yea  introduce yourself again.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp27
You don't have to worry about... Okay  okay  I got confused 'cause you said tell me more.,0.4416,0.289,0.604,0.107,pp27
No  I know  I know  I know.,-0.296,0.0,0.732,0.268,pp27
I don't know why it's worded like that.,0.3612,0.263,0.737,0.0,pp27
Okay  sorry  okay  I was like wait..Am I supposed to...okay  sorry.,0.5719,0.423,0.403,0.174,pp27
Um so I am a junior at MIT studying chemistry and biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I'm primarily interested in how small molecules interact with biological systems such as um the effects of drugs or uh toxins or other uh metabolites on the body and its cells.,0.4019,0.083,0.917,0.0,pp27
MMmm-hmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I've done research since uh like coming to MIT at in the lab of professor [sounds like] Jonessiben in chemistry and biological engineering.,0.6124,0.192,0.808,0.0,pp27
I've been looking at the mechanism of a drug that is currently in phase two clinical trials... Oh  wow.,0.5859,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp27
...um for treatment of HIV.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
Umm in addition I have also done organic synthesis to develop um spacers for drug delivery um at the Curie Institute in Paris.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
Okay  Do you think you're a leader?,0.2263,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp27
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I think I am a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I've done work in my dorm house government as dining chair and environmental chair to take a leadership role um and help residents to um express their concerns with the dining plan   Mmm-hmmm Um and to make changes to help make the residential experience um better for them.,0.8074,0.156,0.844,0.0,pp27
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp27
I definitely consider myself a team player.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp27
I've uh done a lot of work in teams in my chemistry and undergraduate labs.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
Mmm-hmmm Uh  we were often working in groups of like two or three.,0.3612,0.172,0.828,0.0,pp27
Um  there have been conflicts in those situations where um it's difficult..like if a team member uh messes up something or even uh before that if team members come to the team with different lab experience due to their research background or classes they've taken before.,-0.3818,0.0,0.945,0.055,pp27
Mmm-hmmm Trying to figure out how to balance it so everyone gets to ex--um do the lab and have hands on experience while at the same time making sure that things go smoothly and that we work in an efficient manor.,0.6249,0.116,0.884,0.0,pp27
Um so it's..it can be difficult to balance these things such that everyone gets a fai-um a fair chance at doing the hands-on component but we generally resolve this by taking turns and the people who are more experienced kind of uh  you know  supervise in almost a mentor-like way the person who has less experience.,0.5859,0.109,0.862,0.029,pp27
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp27
If you were given the offer to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I would-if I could change one thing about myself- it would be to l..uh to be able to let go of things that have happened and like negative things that have happened more easily because I find that sometimes I can dwell on negative things that have happened and it causes me to worry a lot about the future and become very anxious or to hinder what I want to do in the future like being concerned..you kn...being so worried about performance in a class after not doing well on an exam that I get stressed out for the next exam.,-0.8801,0.088,0.747,0.165,pp27
Mmm-hmmm mm-hmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
And that can create like a negative cycle so if I could change one thing it would be learning how to put bad things behind me and move ahead.,-0.5574,0.125,0.679,0.196,pp27
It's something I've definitely been working on  and having to work on since I can to MIT where you get used to  you know  a lot of things  Mmm-hmm mmm-hmmm mmm-hmm  Not have negative things happen but learning to push through that.,0.4308,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp27
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp27
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp27
I think I should get the job because I have experience from my--from my course work which is very rigorous at MIT in addition to my practical experience with research which has taught me what the research process is like  how to ask questions  how to work independently  and to pre--uh to present results and interpret them.,0.0276,0.042,0.918,0.04,pp27
Umm and that's good skills  I think for the work place.,0.4404,0.225,0.775,0.0,pp27
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp27
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
I'm doing pretty well  how are you?,0.6486,0.515,0.485,0.0,pp29
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp29
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Um  so as far as my technical experience background goes; um I've worked in three different labs.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Um the summer after my freshman year I worked in a lab through um through MGH and located in Charleston.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
I worked with a Harvard graduate student on her PH.D Thesis which involved a lot of genetics and I did a lot of like very routine lab work.,0.3612,0.085,0.915,0.0,pp29
Um and that was just for the summer  and then the next  um my soft-more year I worked in a lab here at MIT  um the Engelward laboratory that works with DNA damage and I worked on an essay that quantified DNA damage using um electrophoresis.,-0.7506,0.0,0.873,0.127,pp29
Which was nice because I got to learn a lot of um different laboratory techniques and because I'm still currently working there.,0.4215,0.118,0.882,0.0,pp29
I've had the time to delve into the project a little bit more have a deeper understanding than I was initially.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Um and it also incorporates um components of coding like we use the math lab area um to um generate our data  so it's been really interesting for me.,0.6697,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp29
Um and also this past summer I worked in a laboratory in Israel  which was really interesting they worked with all sorts of bio-sensors um so it's a pretty broad um field that they worked in; and I got to work on my own project.,0.7548,0.131,0.869,0.0,pp29
I've never had that type of independent freedom which was really exciting for me.,0.8268,0.391,0.609,0.0,pp29
Um and I think what I got more out of that was that just getting used to such a different work place and being able to acclimate myself and um be productive in that sort of environment  so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Great  okay.,0.7184,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp29
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Um  I think I'm definitely a leader  I am willing to take charge of a situation um in a group of people.,0.4019,0.114,0.886,0.0,pp29
I'm not afraid to stand  out or have my opinions heard; um and on the flip-side I'm not afraid to suffer consequences if uh there's any sort of negative outcome or negative or positive outcome I'm willing to handle um the results.,-0.3056,0.124,0.729,0.148,pp29
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp29
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Can you give me an example when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp29
Um  I think I'm a team player because  I'm willing to agree to others peoples um ideas um the question was a  what was  sorry could you repeat the  Conflict on your team Conflict in my team okay.,-0.128,0.102,0.762,0.136,pp29
Um so I in my sorority I'm on the executive board there's 10 of us and we're lke in charge of the chapter; and so um we've just all been newly elected to or positions so we're kind of going through the process of working out exactly what our goal is.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
And recently one of the topics have been like how to handle um judiciary issues like within our chapter and I have like very strong feelings on the subject as do other of my sisters.,0.8777,0.264,0.736,0.0,pp29
And so being able to kind of handle that and be very professional and try to be unbiased because um I have like close relations with like other sisters in the chapter has been um a challenge.,0.6369,0.156,0.817,0.027,pp29
And I think being able to remove myself emotionally from the situation and kind of listen to what the other people are saying and acknowledge that has been really  one of the like  biggest steps I've taken into kind of overcoming those kinds of challenges.,0.4215,0.081,0.919,0.0,pp29
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp29
If you were given an offer to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp29
Um  think  all I can think is like superficial things like the ability to sing or something like that.,0.8316,0.395,0.605,0.0,pp29
Um  I would like to be able to think a little bit faster on my feet  as I took a very long time to answer that question.,0.3612,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp29
Um I think I've given time I think I can come up with like good ideas and good responses and like handle issues in a good way.,0.9136,0.384,0.616,0.0,pp29
Um and I think that just being able to think of something a little bit quicker I know that sometimes there's like  times of crisis and it takes me a little bit longer than I would like to be able to um come up with the like ideal solution.,0.7964,0.219,0.713,0.068,pp29
So that would be one of my things I'd like to change.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp29
I think I'm able to combat it pretty well by  taking steps to you know mitigate the situation like handle it but ultimately that would be one thing I'd like to improve on.,0.8689,0.303,0.655,0.041,pp29
Great; and why do you think you should get the job?,0.6249,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp29
Um  I think I should get the job because I'm a very hard worker and in whatever position I am in I will do it to the best of my ability.,0.701,0.18,0.774,0.047,pp29
Um I have experience in a lot of different areas um as I mentioned in my lab experience and I think the aspect that makes me unique from other people looking for this position  is my perspective; um I'm able to see a problem pretty unbiasedly  and judge what would be the best um solution and also see potential obstacles on the way there and potential outcomes; and so I think that my general overview overview of problems gives me an advantage over other people.,0.5719,0.12,0.798,0.082,pp29
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp29
So uh.. please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp3
Hah.. uh yeah..so.. uhm I'm chase and I guess uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp3
Aww man okay so  i've done web development for a long time  I started in abotu 8th grade and actually started making a few sites just back then and for the heck of it and uhm just started making some money through them sold a website through them which was great.,0.7184,0.109,0.891,0.0,pp3
Uhm and through all fo this I got an internship for my sophmore year of high school  which was awesome.,0.6249,0.177,0.823,0.0,pp3
It was through a job search website called indeed and over there I did a ton of different stuff and from internationalization  I was one of the first people to start the internationalization forum for indeed  and so they've now expanded to four countries and I think  the international traffic revenue is like 30% of their company now.,0.3612,0.042,0.958,0.0,pp3
They also just got sold for like a billion dollars uh I believe..about three weeks ago or something which was really cool.,0.624,0.203,0.797,0.0,pp3
But at the same time I don't really want to work there anymore  because they have been sold and I don't really know the owner anymore where as I did previously and that was great where I don't know  otherwise  coming to MITF you know had aphenomenal blast up there.,0.7177,0.102,0.868,0.03,pp3
I had been studying computer science..uhm really enjoyed it and spent a lot of time on a lot of various side projects and just ahnging out with people so like  I don't know  making really cool robotics stuff... uhm like  cool educational software.. uhm some kinnect tax and different things like this.,0.9406,0.267,0.733,0.0,pp3
That sounds really interesting.,0.4576,0.499,0.501,0.0,pp3
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp3
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp3
Uhm..I would I..I would go this.. I I would say there is kind of uhm from two standpoints both from high school and from college  in high school I was the captain of our ultimate frisbee team..uhm and so I started it in my junior year and just got all my friends  because we used to play frisbee all with each other and I said hey  why don't we start competing and make this happen liek three times a week or soemthing and so we went ahead and did this and uhm.. uh started practicing enough and I had to make sure that everything was coordinated and that people actually came to practices  I mean you like had to have everyone come and everything otherwise no one is going to wanna play or there is going to be no ability to play basically.. so uhm we  played enough so that we were actually able to get 3rd in uhm well actually 3rd in my senior year  5th my junior year and uh in the state of texas in frisbee which is uh impressive without a coach.,0.9517,0.114,0.865,0.021,pp3
Uh  otherwise I was also the captain of the crosscountry team and uhm  uh captain of uhm uh the track team as well  so uhm that um roles been more minimal  more of an inspirational role like make sure you come to practice sort of thing.,0.8578,0.199,0.801,0.0,pp3
of stuff and uhm in college here I've been working with a group called saftey fp and uh  which promotes student wellness around campus  sounds like you've heard of it.,0.7783,0.224,0.776,0.0,pp3
uhm and yeah  so just making sure we have awesome events that happen  I just recently read an event called super smash bros turned in which was really great  uhm..I don't know anything about super smash bros  so... I had to actually go get the the other people that knew a lot about it and made sure they told all their friends about it  and got them to actually figure out the whole thing the whole logistics and that wa sme just getting them excited about it  and and convinced them to get a lot of people to come.,0.9842,0.262,0.738,0.0,pp3
So uhm thinking about all those teams  and where you were a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp3
Tell me about a time when there was conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.124,0.766,0.11,pp3
Uhm okay definitely I enjoy teams like no other  I'm at MIT specifically  I go out of my way to like  working in teams and in any different aspect and for the most part  I've had really great teams in general  but uhm just this semester  I'm actually working on a start up with a friend  so he's been working on it a while and he's just such an awesome guy  that I was just like Oh  i want to build stuff for you so  I am kind of doing contract work for him  we are just hacking together all the time  really just like  there are no conflicts there frankly but I find but otherwise for my year off  for my reasearch that I'm doing here for MIT  uhm i had previously uh a research postion  at uh my freshman year  uhm but I did not really like it that much because  I had to do it by myself because it was an android thing  I mean I don't know I feel like I can always do stuff by myself  it does not have to be in a group  but now actually i just tell all my friends  if they hear about an opp they should just invite me to do it with you  because I would just love to do a year off with someone because like  I'd love to have someone that I like to working with and to work on the same product would make everything so much better  so like my friend does this cool photography and I just do the tech thing  it is fun  but in terms of conflicts I've had  uhm I feel like conflicts are a general minimal for the uhm the most part that I have found  it's most like  who is going to do what  uhm and in these cases uhm and for the most part and uhm i'm pretty flexible basically  that's how I just go around stuff and just try and explain everything very well  to everyone just to make sure everyone knows exactly what is going on and just reinterating all this to everyone so that  *cough cough* at least then so everyone is on the same page.,0.9981,0.223,0.751,0.025,pp3
Because for the most part people generally care to be fair but you just have to describe to everyone how they understand things.,0.4118,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp3
Interesting  some of that is interesting  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.6597,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp3
Uhm  okay so I would   something I woudl change about myself  okay so that's interesting  uhm oh okay I would almost  uhm  heh  uhm..the dumb answer to this would be that I woudl like to be a bit taller  i think that would always help.,0.8051,0.25,0.667,0.083,pp3
Uhm but I think I can also interpret this question on what would I like to work on..or what am I working on.,0.5023,0.129,0.871,0.0,pp3
Fair enough.,0.3182,0.697,0.303,0.0,pp3
And like in thsi case  i would definitely go for uhm actually my ability to  speak ah hah and uhm just in general and uh like I find for now for example  like how I kind of seem like I understand what I'm tlaking about for exmample  for the most part  I  *mumbles* everynow and then but uhm what I'm actually thinking about harder problems and I'm trying to explain myself where I just worked on a hard problem I only looked at once so I don't fully understand everything  for the most part I get it in my head but when I try and explain it to someone  i it's actually pretty hard to me.,0.3612,0.114,0.807,0.079,pp3
And to uhm..everything in an uhm I guess interesting manner  well almost and kind of say it once instead of say something and then which is what I do freqently and then I say oh wait that does not make sense  let me try another avenue.,0.5859,0.098,0.902,0.0,pp3
I just keep trying different avanues until the other person gets it  but I would love to be able to just give it that first time  I can just think for a second and say okay this is exactly what I need to say.,0.8462,0.163,0.837,0.0,pp3
Use the vocabulary words I need to use  which frankly I'm not that good at  and in terms of expanding my vocabulary and expanding my words for whatever like dictionary or see I don't even know the word  like my expanse of the vocabulary that exists in my head and uh on an given and at any given time  not as large as it should be.,0.3806,0.071,0.895,0.034,pp3
So uh  give about all we talked about today  thanks again for sharing   why do you think  why do you think you should get this job?,0.6908,0.192,0.808,0.0,pp3
Uhm  So I know  I.. I would say it just comes down to the passion for the most part  I just really enjoy anything that I am working on  if I am ever going to pck something to work on  i bascially just go at it full force  I always tlak to my friends about it  it's always on my mind in the shower  it's like always in the top of my mind  I am working on a problem and I have to get that problem finished  and I basically  I never really feel like suffer from burn out  that may be because I haven't worked on soemthing enough uhm but uhm  for the msot part  i really enjoy working on stuff and I just  it's my passion and my passion is actually just like working  when i get tired of working  i work on something else  it's actually a relaxing state  like if I am working here for example  I do hard in all my classes  I just start programming.,0.9674,0.165,0.769,0.066,pp3
I feel in a great place  I'm either working out or working on soemthing  I I I I think your company woudl love to see someone like that.,0.8957,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp3
Thanks Chase  I apprec.,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,pp3
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
I’m doing well Can you tell me more about your background?,0.2732,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp30
I’m a student of computer science at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
I’m in my Junior year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
I’ve been studying the whole time.I’ve been teaching last summer in the field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
It was a start up in Venice Beach  California and I enjoyed it quite a bit.,0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp30
Great do you think you’re a leader?,0.6249,0.406,0.594,0.0,pp30
Tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
I think that I ca be a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
I am definitely not one that tends to lead.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,pp30
I am perfectly happy to play a more supportive role  because in my experience especially here there are plenty of people who like to lead and leaders are not needed.,0.9359,0.38,0.62,0.0,pp30
That said if there’s something that needs to be done and nobody is stepping up to do it that is something that I can and will adapt to Great  do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example of where you were on a team and there was a conflict and you had to resolve it?,0.6597,0.1,0.866,0.034,pp30
I would absolutely consider myself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
I care more about people than basically anything else.,0.4939,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp30
Conflict?,-0.3182,0.0,0.0,1.0,pp30
I’m sorry I am trying to think of a story.,-0.0772,0.0,0.874,0.126,pp30
That’s all right  a class project or anything like that?,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp30
So to be honest I haven’t experienced major conflicts in general.,0.1706,0.231,0.582,0.187,pp30
Honestly I think it is best to keep open terms of communication I that makes it so that you can’t have a disaster happen.,0.4767,0.223,0.65,0.127,pp30
There can be minor disagreements but they never turn into big conflicts.,-0.6486,0.0,0.654,0.346,pp30
Okay and if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.2263,0.101,0.899,0.0,pp30
I’d be smarter  yeah obviously but  I think I would like to have a better capability to understand those sides of things.,0.8658,0.373,0.627,0.0,pp30
Sorry that sounds really weird.,-0.3167,0.0,0.477,0.523,pp30
In general I do but for computer science or science specifically there’s the part that I am really good at which is everything that has to do with languages and puzzle solving that’s great.,0.933,0.296,0.704,0.0,pp30
That’s fun.,0.5106,0.767,0.233,0.0,pp30
I like it a lot.,0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,pp30
But then there is also the side that is a little bit more mathematical and that is something that I struggle with.,-0.4497,0.0,0.877,0.123,pp30
They are definitely different things people are typically good at either one or the other but being good at both is a little less common and that would be really awesome.,0.9292,0.337,0.663,0.0,pp30
Okay  and why do you think you should get the job?,0.2263,0.16,0.84,0.0,pp30
Because I think I would do a great job for you guys.,0.6249,0.272,0.728,0.0,pp30
I care a lot about my work especially when it affects other people and I really like what this company is doing.,0.7178,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp30
It is something that I believe in.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp30
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
I’m good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp31
I’m good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp31
Tell me a little more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Uh  so I’m a junior in computer science and math at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Uh  I’m personally interested in [] systems uh and uh [] tolerance those are slightly more my research interests then my applied interests so when it comes to applied things  which you’re probably more interested in um  I tend to prefer parallel computing.,0.8795,0.242,0.758,0.0,pp31
Um I have some experience in that from classes  um both including performance engineering and parallel computing as well as from my internship with Amazon where we actually pushed a product that I made.,0.4215,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp31
Really?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
You can see it I if you look online uh author rank was my intern product.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
That’s great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp31
[laugh] ok  you think you’re a leader  tell me why.,0.7003,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp31
Um… I have some leadership experience but I think that so in my teens for 6172  which is a project based live class … it’s been a lot of work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Um I tend to be the person who does some of the organizing of team meetings but mostly within a given meeting I tend to be  like  for a non-trivial portion of the work.,0.5023,0.09,0.91,0.0,pp31
The person who is leading the discussions of what’s the next technical step we should do  you know  should we take approach A or   should we take approach A or B based on time  work  you know  man hours we have  due dates  uh points  etcetera.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Um  and so I  you know  perform leadership skills in a technical capacity more than a managerial one.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
In a sense that I don’t do so much of the organizing of meeting times.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
And do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Can you give an example of when there was a conflict with your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp31
Um  I do think I’m a team player  um so  can I ask what kind of flavor of conflict you’re looking for?,-0.3182,0.0,0.901,0.099,pp31
Like a technical disagreement or… Anything where there was a problem that you had to solve.,-0.2263,0.2,0.558,0.242,pp31
Ok  um  well while I was working at Amazon  um we had many times the problem that the business decision would change or um become apparent slowly over time as we continued designing because actually the design process started getting [] over the internship and the product shipped shortly after my internship [] Mmmhmm.,0.3182,0.102,0.852,0.046,pp31
So that was kind of crazy  um and you may expect with a project like that I ended up not working on the front end because it was way too much work for one intern to do for the summer  um  but  negotiating with the business team and with other technical people about what parts of the product we were going to ship was a challenge.,0.0909,0.047,0.926,0.027,pp31
As an example  Amazon often has uh  like  you know  lots of features like any company  like to employ and some of these are like change over time features.,0.8658,0.328,0.672,0.0,pp31
And as it turns out  given the way we were implementing everything  change over time features  where it looked that longer periods of time would be much more computationally intensive and like also programmer time intensive  um both of which weren’t going to work for what we were trying to do for our deadline because we couldn’t order more computational power within the time period and we only had so many man hours.,0.3612,0.034,0.966,0.0,pp31
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
And um trying to decide what things would be worked on and what wouldn’t was a conflict of the team um and I did my best  um  you know I was an intern  um but I did my best to like present the technical issues  present my understanding of how long things would take  um  and try to you know  encourage people to take the direction they wanted but in the case that a choice was made that wasn’t you know  what I wanted  uh you know I would go along with it.,0.9473,0.152,0.832,0.016,pp31
I wasn’t you know going to be petulant or continue trying to you know argue my way and not do their way  like if the team decided this was the best thing like I went ahead and did it.,0.7783,0.197,0.751,0.052,pp31
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp31
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Uh  Smarter.,0.4588,0.75,0.25,0.0,pp31
[both laugh] Um  I’m going to respond to this question by answering what I would change about myself that’s sort of something I could just spend more time on um to change.,0.5574,0.104,0.896,0.0,pp31
Mhmm And I can tell you something that I’m currently working on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Which is that when I’m stressed and tired  I notice that  I become snippy  is one word for it.,-0.6486,0.0,0.762,0.238,pp31
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Uh  and while people who have worked with me and you know work on psats until 4 am or you know working on these intense projects  you know claim that I tend to be pretty reasonable like  it does decrease team unity and happiness .,0.8625,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp31
Right right right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
When it’s like getting to be 4am and I respond shortly as opposed to you know sounding nice and happy about it.,0.8402,0.321,0.679,0.0,pp31
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Um so something I’m working on is like removing the sounds of frustration from my voice  especially in time of frustration because it more important then when everybody’s frustrated and tired to like not escalate situations.,-0.7512,0.146,0.597,0.257,pp31
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Um and even if I’m not responding with anger and just responding in like a voice that portrays frustration you can worry that like it’ll make other people more frustrated.,-0.4009,0.192,0.576,0.232,pp31
Right  good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp31
And what  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp31
Um I’m technically competent  I think my uh the classes I’ve taken and how well I’ve done in them as well as you know  any of the people you contact like Amazon will say positive things about me uh  I get along well with people  um and so whatever team you put me on will likely enjoy my company.,0.9485,0.278,0.722,0.0,pp31
[Laughs] Um  and I think most importantly  computer science is a huge part of my life and what I do and I fully and legitimately enjoy my job  especially if you give interesting technical problems Um and I’m sure that’s what your company will do right?,0.9162,0.284,0.669,0.046,pp31
[Laughs] So I’m not going to be just like sitting around  biding my time waiting for the work day to end and I’m actually going be here on time  and I’m going to leave and go home and do other things and like come back and be excited to be coming back to work and continue to work on these problems.,0.7717,0.153,0.791,0.056,pp31
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp31
How are you today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp32
I'm good how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp32
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp32
You seem a little out of breath.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp32
Yeah  I paced here hahaha Um  so tell me more about your background.,0.7003,0.345,0.655,0.0,pp32
Ok I am a junior at MIT currently  uh working on my bachelor's degree in biology and I've been heavily involved in student groups so far and during my time here I've been at  uh I'm currently the president of the MIT armenian society  the editor in chief of the MIT undergraduate research journal and uh um also executive team of the Biology Students Association uh and I that's why I'm sort of trying to get into healthcare industry and consulting cuz I don't have a lot of experience in the life sciences so far.,0.296,0.023,0.977,0.0,pp32
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp32
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp32
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp32
I do think I'm a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp32
Um  I so- always end up taking the lead on uh when there's a big group and someo-someone has to start ha  taking the wheel and uh getting people started working.,0.34,0.074,0.926,0.0,pp32
Um  I've been really involved in the groups that I've -heheh  joined since my freshman year and uh so far I've done some pretty crazy things such as organizing a hundred plus networking event for the armenian society where I definitely had to um  you know uh work with uh the team and get them motivated enough to help me with this like big task  a lot of people-a lot of kids on my team don't really like the whole social um event planning part of things  but um I had to kind of engage them and uh that was an interesting thing for me to learn actually how to tap into what makes people take and what gets them motivated so how to give them initiative to do things on their own so.,0.9391,0.135,0.842,0.023,pp32
Great Yeah Ok  do you consider yourself a team player?,0.8176,0.548,0.452,0.0,pp32
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.1,0.811,0.089,pp32
Yeah uh definitely  I-I-I would say that I'm a team player and um one thing I can say is that uh last year at the MIT  MIT undergraduate research role we uh had to publish an issue uh in the fall where it became late and we had to uh work together as a team to get that done.,0.5994,0.079,0.921,0.0,pp32
uh one  one thing that may  I may have done wrong on my part was maybe I-I-I didn't um get my department to uh work hard enough to get the deadline  make the deadline so um in the spring semester when we were trying to uh make it make uh make the deadline in the spring semester to publish uh in the first week of the spring semester I had to do the same thing that I did with our (research?),-0.5423,0.0,0.946,0.054,pp32
I-or was get everyone to be motivated and have initiative to do things on their own and really like work hard to get t-ah that deadline so yeah.,0.7903,0.252,0.699,0.048,pp32
Ok mhmm Karen  given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.296,0.128,0.872,0.0,pp32
Interesting question.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,pp32
Uh I would change my lack of willingness that sometimes to approach new people and you know put myself into new situations that I'm not comfortable with.,-0.4408,0.068,0.772,0.161,pp32
Um I-I definitely have the-the whatever I am comfortable with I feel very confident and I come off as confident at the moment heh  but  um  I sometimes I'm-I-whenever I approach those new situations I'm pretty  I'm pretty shy and I-I don't I don't feel comfortable so one thing I would like to change my- about myself is being more adventurous and being more of a risk-taker and I-I feel like I'm too controlled at times but that has gotten me also a-ha very far but it's always good to be a balanced person.,0.9735,0.259,0.68,0.062,pp32
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp32
Hahahaha And uh  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp32
K So I'm a good leader  as I uh said I uh organize a team of around 10 people to organize 100+ networking event people networking event  Um I have this ability to understand people where like I which I have to do when I uh have to uh get people to be motivated and like realize what made them take and what made them have initiative on their own so I have a good sense of understanding people um and third  I like I said I'm very controlling  like y-know not controlling but  wrong word  controlled  haha I-I like to uh really get organized and really um put alot of effort into sort of you know um I guess I guess perfecting every aspect of the-a project that I'm working on whether it be an event  a-a-a homework assignment  whatever so uh I have that ability as well.,0.9843,0.209,0.791,0.0,pp32
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp32
Yep.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp32
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Good  how are you?,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,pp33
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp33
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
So  my background is primarily in energy work.,0.2732,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp33
So  I'm a chemical engineering student and I'm very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources.,0.7677,0.283,0.668,0.049,pp33
Um  so that's  that's where my  uh  background in  well in gas comes in.,0.2732,0.139,0.861,0.0,pp33
Um  but also some of my research interests are you know  kind of scientific ideas.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp33
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp33
Um  do you think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Um  I definitely think I am.,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp33
Uh  partially because even when I'm not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
But I really enjoy that.,0.6946,0.542,0.458,0.0,pp33
I think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that you're doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you.,0.902,0.257,0.743,0.0,pp33
So  I think that in terms of my leadership style I always want to bring out the strengths of  the team members.,0.4588,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp33
So I think that's really how my position as a leader really works.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
I try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
And how can we bring all of those together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp33
Do you consider yourself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Can you give me an example of where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.109,0.795,0.096,pp33
Um  yeah  so  I definitely consider myself a team player.,0.6344,0.393,0.607,0.0,pp33
It's tough to be a good leader without being a good team player.,-0.0015,0.173,0.595,0.232,pp33
Ah  but one instance where I was both the leader and also a team player um  was in the Society of Women Engineers banquet.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
So  when we planned it  it was...I'm the vice president of corporate relations and I have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people  both company representatives and students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
And um  and it's a very collaborative effort.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Like  I may be the VP but we're all you know  pulling a lot of the weight.,0.1901,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp33
And so during the actual event  we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without RSVP-ing or anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Uh  it was  the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive.,0.7506,0.262,0.738,0.0,pp33
So what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests.,0.5994,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp33
So it's not something where you can be like  Oh yeah  sit right down but  so  in terms of being a team player  they approached one of the other members of the team.,0.3291,0.098,0.902,0.0,pp33
She didn't really know what to do um  kind of bounced it to a few different people but I knew that that was something that wouldn't look good.,-0.4782,0.0,0.897,0.103,pp33
So I definitely helped her out  out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that  Oh  you don't have our name tags  you don't have our seats?,-0.0314,0.13,0.716,0.154,pp33
What's going on?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
And so I  you know  part of being a team player is knowing when it's best to take the blame on yourself.,0.4215,0.158,0.752,0.09,pp33
And in the end we found places for them to sit.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
So  we had some no-show students  you know  among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that don't show up.,0.6369,0.206,0.794,0.0,pp33
So they didn't get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner.,0.1901,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp33
So  that helped.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp33
If you had the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
I wish I was more patient.,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp33
Um  I think I  a lot of times and very eager to start a task.,0.4201,0.166,0.834,0.0,pp33
This especially comes out  uh  we're in a lab group right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
Or  I'm in a lab class and I work with a lab group  um  in that class and we are all  we kind of have this trait of  um  oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench  oh let's mix this  let's do this  let's do this.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
But a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to  we problem solve.,-0.3291,0.082,0.785,0.133,pp33
We get all the problems first  you know  other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesn't work at all.,-0.4019,0.0,0.891,0.109,pp33
So  we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had  if we could take a few minutes wait  think it out  uh  maybe let somebody else try something first for a change  um  I think that would helps us be a little bit more effective.,0.6936,0.115,0.885,0.0,pp33
And I think in other situations too it's kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but it's sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities.,0.5499,0.179,0.765,0.056,pp33
So I definitely  that's definitely something that I've been working on  is  you know  when  when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it.,0.6887,0.147,0.853,0.0,pp33
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp33
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
I think that I would bring a great deal of enthusiasm.,0.7906,0.438,0.562,0.0,pp33
In addition to the skills and background that I have  I think that I'm so excited  um  for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well.,0.7448,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp33
Um  so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp33
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
Doing pretty good.,0.7269,0.859,0.141,0.0,pp34
Good!...Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
So I am a  uh  mechanical engineer at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
Umm  I am a junior  and I'm really interested in product design.,0.4576,0.214,0.786,0.0,pp34
So I've been taking a lot of classes in design and manufacturing  and it's something I've really fallen in love with...Like last semester  um  especially  I took this class called...[0:25 unclear] Product Design  and it's really got me introduced to solid works and using machine tools  and it's something that I'd love to do in  um  for the rest of my life in a professional fashion.,0.7558,0.135,0.802,0.063,pp34
Great... Do you think you're a leader?,0.6249,0.406,0.594,0.0,pp34
And tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
Uh  I would say that I am.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
I do enjoy being in a position where I can really guide a group  um  towards some forward direction  uh... So  this past year  I was philanthropy chair of my sorority  and we put on this big event called Cat Walk.,0.4939,0.074,0.926,0.0,pp34
It's this charity fashion show.,0.4215,0.412,0.588,0.0,pp34
Um  and it's  it's so much fun  but it took tons of planning  and... Oh  wow... Yeah  coordination between  like  throughout the entire sorority  which has one-hundred forty girls in it... Mmm... Um  and everyone had to play a role  so it's...really difficult sometimes 'cause people aren't really sure what's going on  and there's a lot of... mmm... ...miscommunication and things... Umm  but I feel like it ran really smoothly  um  because I had two co-chairs  and we all really worked together to keep things very organized  um  regimented to  like  keep after people...especially in the summer when everyone's all over the country  all over the world.,0.9494,0.181,0.768,0.05,pp34
Right?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
And you have to just keep emailing them  calling them if you can  um  checking up on them  but  you know?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
Finding a balance  you have to learn to trust the people that are under you  right?,0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp34
Um  and just make sure they have a good idea of what's going on  and they feel like they're playing an important role  because they are... Um  so that happened actually two weeks ago... the event... Oh wow... It was so much fun!,0.9514,0.345,0.655,0.0,pp34
It was a little bit stressful as we got closer to the event... mmhmm... ...You know  things go wrong  and things go missing.,-0.8085,0.0,0.706,0.294,pp34
Um... but I feel like I was able to stay very calm  and just  like  help people find alternatives if they...If  I don't know  if  like  a rehearsal time didn't work  or a designer wasn't showing up.,0.8951,0.279,0.665,0.055,pp34
Um  it was just best to find a very efficient  logical way to proceed.,0.807,0.378,0.622,0.0,pp34
Great... Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0,pp34
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team  and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp34
Uh  I would say that I'm a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
Again  like even when in a leadership role  you're not just the one person doing the... mmhmm.,0.3612,0.135,0.865,0.0,pp34
...thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
Um  I would say that being a team player applied to Cat Walk as well  but  um  for a different example  perhaps... I might return to  to product design  where we had to work in a smaller team of about  uh  there were five students and two mentors.,0.1406,0.032,0.968,0.0,pp34
Um  and we all came from different backgrounds  and none of us knew each other beforehand.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
We all had very different skill sets and very different personalities... Mmhmm... Um  so in the beginning  especially  we all had ideas that really clashed  and for the class  in a way that was good  because then we could come up with all these different ideas  and it's great... Mmm... ...But then  when it came down to deciding on one or figuring out how you wanted to move forward  who would take on which responsibilities  it was  um  quite tense (laughs) for our team  I would say... Um  so  as the oldest two on the team  myself and one other teammate  we... I feel like we really stepped it up in terms of being  um  very methodical and very  like... Okay... ...Fair  I guess?,0.9641,0.172,0.803,0.025,pp34
In the way that we tried to distribute things?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp34
And when things got too heated  um  I feel like I especially served as kind of a mediator  calming people down and just  like  having them think about  y'know  what's practical  what are you actually able to get done?,0.7717,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp34
Um  what do you want to get done?,0.0772,0.157,0.843,0.0,pp34
'Cause you want to make sure that people work on things that they're passionate about  um  so they can do their best work.,0.8807,0.371,0.629,0.0,pp34
Um  I feel like that's just a role that I play in a lot of team situations?,0.5994,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp34
Um  helping our team to find a balance so that we can work together most effectively... Right...If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.659,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp34
Uh  for me  I would definitely try to (laughs) raise my own confidence level?,0.8481,0.455,0.545,0.0,pp34
Um  or my ability to be more assertive.,0.3182,0.247,0.753,0.0,pp34
I think that when I'm in a team situation where there are very strong personalities  I tend to...I don't mind sharing my ideas  but then  as soon as I do  if it receives like a lot of criticism or... Mmhmm... ...Some sort of  um  opposition  I'll tend to back down  um  and just kind of let it go and move forward on something else  but then sometimes those ideas  they turn out to be good ones  in the end and it's just like we kind of... Mmhmm.,0.9141,0.168,0.778,0.054,pp34
...wasted time.,-0.4939,0.0,0.238,0.762,pp34
Um  if only I had more solid arguments to go off of... So... I try to do a lot more planning on my own time.,-0.2698,0.068,0.825,0.107,pp34
Um  so that I do have a solid foundation to go off if I don't get really scared or feel like the ideas I come up with are worthless  and I can't defend them... Mmhmm...Well  why do you think you should get the job?,0.4258,0.135,0.806,0.058,pp34
I think I should get the job because...This position just sounds so ideal for me  um  it seems like a place  like a very collaborative environment?,0.8543,0.289,0.711,0.0,pp34
Where I can really call on different  uh  team members in the office itself  um  to just help me further my own ideas... And I have a lot of room for creative freedom in this product design position...Um  because from what I've found out through research and talking to  uh  [5:41 unclear] or company members  um... Mmhmm... ...is just that we're often given a challenge that's very dynamic  and there's always problems to be solved and  um  things to innovate on... Mmhmm... And...they basically just say Go do it.,0.9273,0.186,0.769,0.045,pp34
Um  and I think that's really exciting to me because I don't...I'm not a big fan of  of just doing things very rotely  like  Here's how I want you to do it... Um  just  like  build exactly what these directions tell you to do.,0.7969,0.197,0.764,0.038,pp34
Mmhmm... Um  not quite what I'm looking for  and so I think this company  um  this position just really  really excites me.,0.5678,0.149,0.851,0.0,pp34
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp34
Hi  how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
Fine  thanks  how are you?,0.5719,0.61,0.39,0.0,pp35
Good  tell me about your background.,0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0,pp35
Well I'm a junior at MIT and currently I'm majoring in Computer Science and molecular biology with a minor in Management.,0.2732,0.095,0.905,0.0,pp35
Um  my work background  I've done a year op at uh  in Boyden's Lab  uh which is in neurobiology lab and I really like that  but I'm interested in maybe pursuing Finance as a career.,0.6648,0.142,0.858,0.0,pp35
So  the past two summers  um  I've worked in financial services.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
Um  my freshman summer I worked at Standard & Poor's  and last summer I worked at Wells Fargo.,0.25,0.105,0.895,0.0,pp35
Great... Do you think you are a leader?,0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0,pp35
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
Uh  I definitely think I'm a leader because  uh  currently I'm on a lot of planning boards for different things  uh  I'm actually on the Executive Board on Smart Women's Securities which is a finance club  and I've really helped it grow from a very small group of about ten members to now we have like 30 or 40 students attending each of our seminar series so its been great being in a marketing role for that club  uh  because I've been able to pub on campus and get people to come out to our events.,0.9255,0.137,0.863,0.0,pp35
Great...Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.084,0.841,0.074,pp35
Uh  yes  I think I'm a team player um  one time  this was for one of my classes  we had a project  uh it was in a class called software programming in Java.,0.4019,0.078,0.922,0.0,pp35
So  the project was actually centered after Spring Break mmhmm and it was due on that Wednesday.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
However  one of my friends  who was supposed to be in charge of another part of the project  was gone the entire Spring Break  on a bike trip  and didn't bring his computer.,0.4767,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp35
So he came back to school and said  guys  sorry I haven't done anything  and well  that was a very bad conflict for our team  so I kind of took charge and said  Look  okay  I'll finish the parser  and you write  just test cases for the entire program instead since  obviously  you haven't even started looking at it.,-0.5678,0.061,0.822,0.117,pp35
Mmhmm So  yeah  we ended up getting an A on that project  thankfully  but it was a marathon sprint to the finish.,0.3912,0.154,0.846,0.0,pp35
And  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
This is a very loaded question.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
Um  I think one thing  I might change about myself is being a little bit more proactive in everything I do  sometimes I'm a little too passive  but  yeah  I think that's the main thing I would change about myself.,0.6092,0.139,0.861,0.0,pp35
Okay -  I would try to make myself take more initiatives.,0.2263,0.16,0.84,0.0,pp35
Okay...and  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp35
I think I should get the job because I'm a very strong candidate in this industry and I have a lot of prior experience in Finance  so... Also  I'm very motivated and I'll get work done,0.7837,0.168,0.832,0.0,pp35
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Little cold.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Pretty well.,0.6486,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp37
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Good  I am doing well.,0.6124,0.625,0.375,0.0,pp37
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
I have some quantity and analytical experience from Qua work on financial team last summer in terms’ of working experience a in terms of academic experience I have a apply a math major probably double major with course fifteen which is management so I taken a lot of probability statistics classes.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Do you think you are a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Ah  I think I am a leader mainly because I take a leadership positions  I can be very effective in guiding the group whatever it is toward our goal.,0.5256,0.108,0.892,0.0,pp37
If it is team in the class on the research project even if there is a like assign leadership role I usually end up organizing things between people stuff like that.,0.6124,0.147,0.853,0.0,pp37
So I do feel like I am a little bet a natural leader Do you consider yourself a team player and give me a example when you were on the team and there was conflict and you have to resolve.,0.617,0.161,0.789,0.05,pp37
A  when I was in competitive swimming summer for fifteen years pretty much my whole life and so I had lots of different experiences being on the swim team specially on (??),0.644,0.149,0.851,0.0,pp37
I did for two years specialty on m rely team there is only four slots on the rely and we are usually very competitive on the national level so last year we had lots of conflict  a because one of my best fiends really wonted to be on the rely but then you know she is getting bit up by a teammates and there is all that drama over that and it put me in a tough position because was my best friend but then was also you know you wont to put together the fastest rely to be competitive so really all of was wont to stay out of it and let the coaches deal with that but I did learn a lot about how to interact with people on all sides of the situation because I steel had to get along with all my teammates and support my best friend and try to help her.,0.9862,0.183,0.798,0.019,pp37
If you were given a option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
I think I would like to be better in asking for help not that I necessarily needed a lot but I think it would be useful for me and like branch out and learn from different people so I am really interested in math and management so I get really into those types of classes I guess I wish I would branch out little bet more in to different areas because I can learn from people there.,0.9595,0.224,0.776,0.0,pp37
Si I am trying to take some different classes now that I ma done with all of my math and stuff like that.,0.3612,0.102,0.898,0.0,pp37
That’s probably what I should change.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
Why you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
I think  I should get the job because I am really qualified.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp37
I have the qua experience as well some of the financial background.,0.2732,0.16,0.84,0.0,pp37
I am also just a hard worker really excited to learn more in the job and since this is a such learning internship I think I could really thrive in that environment.,0.3167,0.079,0.88,0.041,pp37
So please tell me about your background.,0.3804,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp4
Sure  uh  my names Isaiah I'm an MIT student I am currently a junior in the department of aeronautics and astronautics.,0.3182,0.103,0.897,0.0,pp4
um  and so I  I'm mainly focusing on the information systems behind uhh  aeronautics and  uhh  aeronautical and astronautical flight systems.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
umm  my course work basically has included a fair amount of the basics of aeronautics and astronautics that's covered at MIT.,0.3182,0.103,0.897,0.0,pp4
Uhh  in addition to that I've covered a lot of programming and programming work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
umm  both in and out of school  umm  so that has included  uhh  basically building a UAV from scratch  as well as umm  working on UAV programming for the department of defense  umm  which has  uhh  been done for collision avoidance for a lot of the UAV's now flying in the air.,-0.3818,0.063,0.845,0.092,pp4
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
So  yeah  I do think I'm a leader  umm  so for example  uhh right now I'm actually holding several different leadership positions.,0.3597,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp4
uhh  first of all I am the residential director for a group called [medlinks?],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
in my dorm  uhh  what we do is we provide students  uhh  health care support  basically.,0.7096,0.296,0.704,0.0,pp4
uhh  we are authorized to give out over the counter medicines to other students  uhh  in our dorm  and as well  as well as elsewhere.,0.4939,0.154,0.846,0.0,pp4
uhh we're certified first aid and some basic emergency care  and we're also there for  uhh  basically student health counseling  um  so  in my position as residential director  umm  I basically talk to the dorm executive board as well as the medlinks executive board  and uhh  we basically work together  I work as the Liason between the groups  um  and I basically help plan events  um  I work with them to resolve whatever issues are coming up  I [xx] meetings for them  umm  basically to help support basically the people who support our dorm.,0.9337,0.174,0.801,0.024,pp4
umm  in addition to that  I kind of have like a quirky side leadership position which is umm as president of the MIT tapioca club  umm  we make and distribute large quantities of tapioca  so every once in a while  umm  we will  I will be organizing a whole bunch of students getting together maybe like a night or two of crazy cooking  umm  you know  ha ha Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.7506,0.119,0.852,0.029,pp4
Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.109,0.795,0.096,pp4
Umm  sure  so  uhh  yes I do consider myself a team player  I've had to work in a whole bunch of different teams  for example  one time there was a bit of a conflict  umm  well it was basically when last year I was working on a  uhh  one of my assignments for an engineering class  uh  we had a problem  in which basically one of the students wouldn't show up  one of the other students  [xx] let me get this straight  one of the students had trouble showing up for basically the team meetings  and another one of them kind of basically got [xx] at that.,0.2031,0.081,0.853,0.066,pp4
So the way I helped umm sort of resolve this conflict and basically bring everybody together to try to work out the project was I basically took it upon myself to help the person to figure out why the person who wasn't showing up wasn't showing up  umm  and I basically helped him work through some of the stuff that he had issues with  mainly he wasn't showing up mainly because he felt he didn't like wasn't able to contribute enough  didn't know enough about the programs we were working with  so I basically sat there and talked him through it  helped him basically develop some of the skills necessary to work with it  so in that way he basically showed up a lot more  he was much more productive and useful to the team  and that also um basically helped resolve the conflict we had in which we had you know we avoided losing a team member basically  and we avoided another problem of umm  basically  an annoyed team member having to deal with a person who he felt wasn't doing his job.,-0.7884,0.053,0.849,0.097,pp4
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
Um  so this is actually something that I am actively working on  I feel that I should be more compassionate  um  this is actually something that um  so during my medlinks training  something that actually appeared  um  basically what we were doing  we were doing a bit of an exercise  um  in which we were presented with a couple of different cases  to basically  umm  illustrate  how it might be for a person to go through some very  very difficult  uh  I guess  difficult times or difficult trials  um  and so we were basic  we were given scenarios to imagine sort of  like umm  maybe the loss of a loved one or the loss of a secure place to be  uh  loss of some sort of  you know  a whole bunch of different losing things  and  um  I guess I wasn't  I wasn't as moved as other students were  primarily because I've been through all of the examples that they gave  so  I don't know  I guess on one hand that's a good thing on the other hand that's a bad thing  but umm  what that pointed out to me was that like I wasn't perhaps able to empathize as well as the others were  um  despite  I don't know  either despite  or specifically because  I had been through that  and um  part of the reason that I joined medlinks and am now currently actually trying to join the [MITEMS?],0.8344,0.09,0.853,0.056,pp4
umm  not because I want to pursue medicine as a career  but one  because I want to develop those skills  and two because I want to sort of develop and exercise more compassion.,0.7374,0.196,0.774,0.03,pp4
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp4
Um  so I think I should get the job basically because of one  my past experiences  which have prepared me fairly well for the kind of employee that your looking for  a person with good strong aerospace and science background  as well as strong coding skills that are necessary for the umm basically kind of projects that I know you are working on.,0.9274,0.215,0.785,0.0,pp4
additionally  I feel that I am a very reliable person  um  I have demonstrated that through my leadership positions  through the things that I have  initia-  um  sort of taken the initiative to engage in  such as the various programs I mentioned  and you know  the things I am trying to do right now  because of that I feel that I would be a valuable asset to your team.,0.7906,0.108,0.892,0.0,pp4
Thank you  so I'm curious  what's the tapioca club?,0.6222,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp4
This is off the interview It's what it sounds like.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp4
We try to make it more than boba tea  umm  currently we have primarily made boba tea  so its like  I think we've done like two or three events  and basically every time its like ok I'm gonna go to china town  get like twenty to thirty pounds of tapioca  bring it back  and then like well spend like basically a night or two cooking  making large quantities of tea We tried to sell boba tea here  it was not a profitable operation but it was a fun activity I think what we're trying to do right now is kind of actually get enough funds to get a cup sealing machine  that way the club will be self sustainable  'cause like right now its MIT funded  but its so new that they won't give it consistent funding  we have to apply for new grants.,0.9527,0.151,0.838,0.011,pp4
so we're like  oh you know  we're paying MIT all this money to be here  why not make them give us money for food?,0.4173,0.108,0.892,0.0,pp4
Fair enough  so thank you again for interviewing.,0.624,0.459,0.541,0.0,pp4
So  uh please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp42
My background is I grew up in Japan and wanted to go to M.I.T.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
to study aerospace engineering  wanted to fly for a very long time now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
I am in Sigma Alpha Epsilon  a fraternity on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
And I am also a member of Air Force ROTC.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Interesting.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp42
So  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
I do think I'm a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
I have had many opportunities to lead.,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp42
Um  both in a  in a range of environments where it's  it's pure leadership and also areas it's very clear that I'm the one in charge  and that people should be listening to me.,0.4391,0.081,0.919,0.0,pp42
And I've also had a good amount of theoretical education on this  and most of those opportunities and the education's been through ROTC.,0.6969,0.215,0.785,0.0,pp42
But I have also had a decent amount of chances to lead through things  like student government in high school and through my fraternity in college.,0.6652,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp42
So  uh do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict on a team that you were on and how you worked to resolve it?,0.0772,0.087,0.836,0.077,pp42
I do think I'm a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
I like to be on part of a team where the mission is something I agree with  and if I am then I'll work my absolute hardest and try to make sacrifices for the team.,0.6124,0.132,0.868,0.0,pp42
In terms of a team that had conflict that I was um  I was apart of  uh hmm let me think of examples I didn't use the first time.,-0.3182,0.0,0.924,0.076,pp42
[pause] I have to go back to high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Um  so student government was a really big thing for me in high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
It was probably my favorite activity  my favorite non-athletic activity that I did  and it was a little bit difficult to get participation  especially during busier times for school  because people would have so many other commitments to go to.,0.6749,0.169,0.783,0.048,pp42
So  in some of the committees we had  inside student government Junior  Senior year  there would just be not enough people for not even a quorum to be reached.,0.1027,0.048,0.952,0.0,pp42
So- [laughs] The way I tried to change that was just making the events we do more fun and having people specifically agree on those things that were on the committee beforehand.,0.8516,0.243,0.757,0.0,pp42
So then they-  we knew that everybody had kind of an investment in it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
That makes sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
So if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
One thing about myself  hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
[laughs] Well kind of as a joke right now  one thing definitely have a leg that's healed.,0.8481,0.44,0.56,0.0,pp42
[laughs]  Um  but-  Sorry to hear that.,0.1655,0.246,0.585,0.17,pp42
I guess- A little more changeable note.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
[laughs] Personality traits are something of that nature.,0.4939,0.314,0.686,0.0,pp42
[pause] Um  I think i can be a little bit more agr-  or not a little bit  a decently am-  a decent more-  a decent amount more agreeable.,0.4754,0.103,0.897,0.0,pp42
Sometimes  I certainly can have an opinion on a stance and once it's developed it's quite hard to change.,0.1796,0.114,0.806,0.08,pp42
I can dig my heels in when someone's kind of trying to argue the Congress.,-0.34,0.0,0.854,0.146,pp42
So  if I could be just a little more open minded and certainly more agreeable I think that would help me out in the long run.,0.8016,0.263,0.737,0.0,pp42
That's always very useful.,0.4927,0.516,0.484,0.0,pp42
So  uh  lastly  uh  now imagine you are applying for a job that you want  and you're-  maybe in the military maybe [?].,0.0772,0.056,0.944,0.0,pp42
Why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
I think that I should be able to get this job because I have a lot to contribute to the company.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
I learn so much in my undergrad  and I've been wanting to apply that to a real-  to a tough problem  that has real uh  repercussions to the general public.,-0.4939,0.0,0.87,0.13,pp42
And I've learned a lot of uh  theoretical knowledge on  on how to solve these problems.,-0.2263,0.097,0.757,0.146,pp42
I've also learned a lot of practical things by being in projects  and working in groups  and  and learning how to handle a range-  or a multitude of different dynamics.,0.2732,0.068,0.932,0.0,pp42
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Um  I-  if-  if the team is working towards a goal  which I agree on  and this company certainly is- Mhmm.,0.5994,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp42
I-  I'll put absolutely a hundred percent of effort into it  and work late  and-  and really try to get that goal  um  or really try to work towards that goal.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp42
Ah  very good.,0.4927,0.615,0.385,0.0,pp42
So uh  please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp43
So I am match-making computer science double major at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Mmm-hmmm I worked in the product-tech and business space before umm doing both uh front end web development  for example  at Next Job and product management  for example  at Douche Ban  the German railway and Disney Parks and Resorts online.,-0.7269,0.0,0.862,0.138,pp43
Mmm-hmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp43
I think I..I am.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Umm one example of that is I'm the president of Baker House-it's a dorm at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Oh  yes.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,pp43
Umm and as part of that I--there's about twenty members of the executive committee um and we run um events during the year- about a fifty thousand dollar budget.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Um so making sure all of those run run smoothly um  that there aren't conflicts between members of the team  that the umm other business of Baker House gets done and gets done in an efficient way and a way that's good for the residents that are there.,0.8578,0.192,0.808,0.0,pp43
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Can you give me an example of a time you faced a challenge while you were on a team and how you went about resolving it.,0.4404,0.14,0.86,0.0,pp43
Sure  so this sem-or this past summer at Disney uh we had a challenge once with the time zones um and how they would be uh and how the app would be able to use time zones.,0.3818,0.093,0.907,0.0,pp43
So  we uh spent some time to got everyone on the phone together on a conference call and talked about umm what the app would have to do in order to support time zones.,0.4019,0.076,0.924,0.0,pp43
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp43
Umm if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp43
I think the..the one thing that I um you know  maybe I..I...maybe it's..it's a false sort of sense of of what umm of something but at MIT it always seems like some people get the answers to some questions faster than I do and umm you know  it's it's probably just you know  their particular field that they are good in but you know some magical way of of you know  being able to do that would be good.,0.899,0.126,0.874,0.0,pp43
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp43
Umm so I guess my final question is think of that one job.. Uhh huh... That you would like to have... Yep.. Doing what?,0.5719,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp43
Mmm-hmm  Good  okay.,0.5859,0.828,0.172,0.0,pp43
So  why do you think we should give you this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Absolutely.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
Umm you know  I think it's something that I've...I've certainly done before  something that I'm able to pick up quickly and uh really customize it you know  to this particular company umm and I think that's you know  there's there's few other candidates that have had this sort of graph of experience that I've had.,0.34,0.043,0.957,0.0,pp43
Ah  well thank you for coming.,0.5574,0.535,0.465,0.0,pp43
Yep.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp43
Appreciate you coming for the interview.,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp43
No problem.,0.3089,0.693,0.307,0.0,pp43
Now uh...,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp43
So  uh  please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp44
I’d like to I know a little bit about your background.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,pp44
Sure  um  [clears throat] sorry.,0.3182,0.522,0.29,0.188,pp44
Uh  I am a junior in Computer Science here at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
I’m from [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Kentucky.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Uh  particularly interesting in  uh  consumer [??],0.5192,0.358,0.642,0.0,pp44
products  um  front end development.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Um  I’ve had some experience doing both web development and some  uh  internal metrics testing and QA type of jobs.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
So  that’s a little bit about my technical background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Uh  thank you.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,pp44
You think you’re a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
I do think I’m a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
I think one of the biggest qualities a leader needs to have is dealing with people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Uh  people skills are very important.,0.2716,0.295,0.705,0.0,pp44
I’ve been involved in many situations that  uh  involve both conflict resolution with people  involve organizing people towards a certain  a certain purpose or goal  which I think is  uh  very important  uh  quality of being a leader.,0.4576,0.148,0.798,0.054,pp44
For example  um  previous  uh  work  uh  I’ve done with one of [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
organizations on campus  called Camp [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
of MIT  uh  we had a committee that  my  myself and my co-coordinator had a committee which we  we used to organize the unions for campers and  um  newsletters for  uh  families.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Uh  to give you more context with that  uh  my job in that organization was to be a liaison between organization  which was a student camp  a student run camp for kids whose parents have or had had cancer – Mm.,-0.6597,0.0,0.901,0.099,pp44
- and being a liaison for the organization in the families who go to that camp.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
So  that was my whole last year and I believe I was able to organize  uh  I believe pretty effectively.,0.7269,0.253,0.747,0.0,pp44
Right now  I’m  uh  also a member of the MIT dance troupe  which  uh  is a dance group on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
And I’ve  uh  I’m choreog -   I’m a choreographer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
So  I’m organizing people there and definitely making sure we meet our deadlines on time for the big show that we hold every semester.,0.6124,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp44
So  I think I can  uh  organize people pretty effectively and  uh  have a really good [??].,0.8642,0.408,0.592,0.0,pp44
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
A team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Can you tell me a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you go about resolving it?,0.4404,0.151,0.849,0.0,pp44
Sure  okay.,0.4939,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp44
Um  I think  dealing with  doing these…  Let’s go with  so  uh  the same organization  Camp [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
organization  last year as the coordinator for the  uh  families.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
A big challenge for us was  uh  organizing our data.,0.0772,0.126,0.874,0.0,pp44
Um  so  how that  so  essentially  what I mean by that is each  uh  family had to apply  uh  with their camper’s applications  but the applications itself are pretty  pretty heavy and require a lot of information  doctor’s records  medical records  and so people would send in their applications at different parts – Hm.,0.8625,0.142,0.858,0.0,pp44
- uh  during the year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Um  so they would never usually send in a full application.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
So  keeping track of that  um  proved to be pretty  pretty challenging in itself.,0.7906,0.421,0.579,0.0,pp44
Um  there were about three of us that they would send different parts to  uh  and there were about ninety campers or about a hundred campers who ended up sending in documents.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
So  uh  making sure that  uh  my team was communicating was important  very  very important.,0.6942,0.359,0.641,0.0,pp44
In order to get through that – Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
- um  we decided to develop a  uh  sort of tool for  uh  organizing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
In the sense that –  Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
- uh  whoever received that piece of the application would enter it in to this sort of database we decided to construct.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Uh  fill in the application and contact the family saying what they were missing and what they have turned in.,-0.296,0.0,0.896,0.104,pp44
‘Cause sometimes there was a little bit of a lasp [sic] in communication about who was to tell the parents about what they were missing and things of that nature.,-0.296,0.0,0.929,0.071,pp44
Uh  I think it worked pretty well.,0.6486,0.515,0.485,0.0,pp44
Uh  it was definitely a system which could be used in future years.,0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,pp44
Um – Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
- unfortunately  they switch to a different system  an online system  this year  so we don’t implement anymore.,-0.34,0.0,0.876,0.124,pp44
That was a pretty solid system.,0.5859,0.545,0.455,0.0,pp44
Well  that’s always good to hear.,0.6124,0.556,0.444,0.0,pp44
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp44
Um  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
‘K.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
I think for me –  Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
- um  wrist-taking.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Risk-taking is probably something I could  uh  work on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Now  I don’t mean by risk-taking  taking risks just for the sake of risks  but being more open to  uh  trying something I’m not  uh  particularly  uh  familiar with or  uh  don’t know exactly what the outcome is going to be.,-0.2732,0.0,0.926,0.074,pp44
Uh  it’s definitely something I could  uh  give more thought towards.,0.4019,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp44
I’m generally a conservative person when making decisions and trying to go with  um  solutions that I can definitely plan out and foresee  but I understand that  especially in the real world there are times when  uh  you just don’t know what’s going to happen with  uh  later down the line and decisions have to be made.,0.296,0.055,0.945,0.0,pp44
So  keeping that in mind  um  knowing when to take risk and definitely being more open to alternative ways of  uh  going down a certain path to a solution is something I could  uh  I’d  uh  I’d like to change about myself.,0.7579,0.197,0.76,0.043,pp44
Mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Certainly true for many people.,0.6369,0.634,0.366,0.0,pp44
So  uh  think about the job you’d like to have – Mm.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp44
- why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
So  uh  I think that the biggest  one of the biggest qualities in me  for me  is  uh  being able to  uh  being eager and able to learn very quickly.,0.3612,0.079,0.921,0.0,pp44
I’m a very eager  um  to learn individual.,0.4201,0.285,0.715,0.0,pp44
I’ve  uh  come into internships before not knowing much about the sort of technology and frameworks they use.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
For example  this past summer  at my internship at this small company  uh  I had never used Ruby or many of the JavaScript frameworks they had used before  uh  and many of the testing frameworks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
And I just have to hit the ground running  but I think I have a very  uh  big enthusiasm for learning new things and it’s one of  uh  the greatest joys in the world to me is to  like  go in and just learn  uh  a new technology and put it into practice.,0.9617,0.264,0.736,0.0,pp44
So  I think that  uh  what I may lack for in experience I more than make up for in  uh  very eager  um  to learn  uh  attitude and ability to pick up things pretty quickly in practice.,0.7178,0.19,0.757,0.053,pp44
Ah.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp44
Well  thanks for sharing this all with me.,0.7783,0.609,0.391,0.0,pp44
No problem.,0.3089,0.693,0.307,0.0,pp44
Thanks for having me.,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,pp44
Of course  it was great to meet -,0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0,pp44
So  umm  tell me a little about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
OK  so I'm a student here at MIT  and I love to study electrical engineering and computer science.,0.7983,0.308,0.692,0.0,pp45
Umm  you know  very quantitatively minded.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
I'm also minoring in mathematics and economics  and I'm interested in a variety of applications of math and computer science to  you know  any sort of field that has interesting problems that can bring together a practical application and a use of my technical skill set.,0.4019,0.106,0.841,0.053,pp45
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp45
So uhh  you think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
Yeah  I think so  I think  I think I have umm  I have a talent for being able to identify what motivates people  and in organizations it's very easy to  you know  get caught up in what's perceived to be  you know?,0.8016,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp45
Everyone's common motive that the companies supposed to be about.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
And although the ideal framework would be nice if everyone was working indeed towards the same goal  in reality  sometimes  you know different agents  different people in the company  different people in the group have different  you know  slightly different goals for they're in the game in the first place.,0.7351,0.114,0.886,0.0,pp45
And I think by being able to recognize these individual motives and being able to marshal them  instead of being a destructive force towards the company  being able to marshal everyone's individual talents or desires  umm  as a force that can be used to benefit the company  I think this sort of  you know  deeper  deeper attention to what people want is what  we- wha- wha- what basically makes me be able to be a  you know  a good leader by being able to take all the resources that are provided by the team and use the parts to make a good whole sum.,0.7964,0.114,0.851,0.035,pp45
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
Can you give me an example of a time when you were on a team and there was a conflict you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.093,0.824,0.082,pp45
I think yeah  I uhh  yeah  I am a team player  umm  within reason of course.,0.5267,0.239,0.761,0.0,pp45
As long as I don't think some ridiculous demand is being made of me.,0.1556,0.135,0.769,0.096,pp45
Which is demeaning or it's just  not useful in terms of  it  if there's a demand being made of me that's not fulfilled by me and my skill set  then I will  you know  defer to someone else on the team.,-0.7534,0.0,0.814,0.186,pp45
But  given that it is a demand or a request that's made that will tailor itself to my skill set  I  I think that I'm a team player.,-0.1901,0.0,0.939,0.061,pp45
Umm  you know  for example  I'm more skilled at quantitative analysis than people from maybe other backgrounds  and there have been many times  you know  working on group projects and interdisciplinary crafts   where I would be asked to take on some extra role  for data analysis  just simply because I have more experience in the field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
And  it would be  just more beneficial to the entire to team to have someone who already has more experience.,0.4927,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp45
To not have to enter the learning curve at the steepest point  umm  but instead to be able to produce  you know  good work pretty quickly.,0.8462,0.253,0.747,0.0,pp45
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
If I were to change one- one thing about myself it would umm  it would probably have to be... I guess  being umm  being more mindful of my time and being a little more meticulous to make sure that all those  you know  unaccounted for minutes that past by over the course of the day  uhh  don't add up  you know?,0.3182,0.037,0.963,0.0,pp45
Into large chunks of time that are being unused.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
I wish I had a better sense of realizing quickly when my time is not being used optimally  and freedom to actually correct that.,0.8333,0.309,0.63,0.062,pp45
So now think of a job that you would like to have.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp45
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp45
So  I  I think that for most jobs and this one as well in a very quantitative field  which does also involve  you know  leading a team of different people from various backgrounds  I think that I would be  you know  uniquely skilled for this job  because I do have a strong technical background while I can also take different parts of a team  and bring together people with  you know  they have different motives initially  into a coherent unit to get a job done.,0.6597,0.061,0.939,0.0,pp45
Well thanks for coming by.,0.6124,0.625,0.375,0.0,pp45
Thank you very much.,0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0,pp45
So  uh  please tell me a bit about your background.,0.3774,0.223,0.777,0.0,pp47
So  I'm a math major at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
I'm a junior.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Um  specifically study  uh  Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Uh  I have a focus on statistics and algorithms.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Ah  thank you.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,pp47
Uh  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Um  I think of myself sometimes as a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Um  definitely able to organize things and get things done when they need to be done.,0.4019,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp47
Um  ahem  I'm not the most organized person.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Uh  so in some regard  I have doubt.,-0.3612,0.0,0.737,0.263,pp47
But  uh  I think I've been pretty successful in getting groups to acheive goals and that kind of thing.,0.8885,0.358,0.642,0.0,pp47
OK  so let's talk a bit more about those groups.,0.4466,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp47
Uh  do you think you're a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Can you tell me about a time when you were on a team and you experienced a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp47
How did you resolve it?,0.3818,0.394,0.606,0.0,pp47
Um  so I  I think I am a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Um  I have a pretty diverse background as far as  um  CS and math-related kinda things go and so  um  I'm pretty good at working with different  uh  people from different backgrounds.,0.8612,0.248,0.752,0.0,pp47
Specifically in those fields  uh  also in other fields.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Um  I think the particular challenge with that is being able to communicate to  uh  team members your  your ideas if  uh  they're not exactly familiar with them.,0.0772,0.046,0.954,0.0,pp47
Uh  thank you.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,pp47
So  can you tell me one thing that you would change about yourself if you could?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
If you had an option to change one thing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp47
So  I think one thing that I certainly don't like is that I tend to be very nervous.,-0.2739,0.11,0.685,0.206,pp47
Um  especially when speaking in front of  uh  large groups of people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
And  I think definitely if I could avoid that problem  it's certainly be good.,0.4767,0.365,0.411,0.224,pp47
Um  one of the things because you're always given the opportunity to talk in front of people and it's  uh  whether you're presenting work or you're socializing or something  meeting new people.,0.4215,0.083,0.917,0.0,pp47
It's always something that you have to deal with and  you know  being being very sociable or being around a lot of people is certainly very helpful.,0.8265,0.266,0.734,0.0,pp47
Uh  thank you.,0.3612,0.556,0.444,0.0,pp47
And  uh  why do think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Just think of a job you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp47
Um  so  I think one of the reasons is that I enjoy a good challenge.,0.7506,0.381,0.619,0.0,pp47
Um  and I enjoy very challenging problems which I know that your company certainly offers.,0.5446,0.349,0.512,0.139,pp47
Um  another reason is the  my  my interests are very aligned with the company's interests  and I think that  um  both could benefit from learning  uh  especially myself  from your company and the people I work with.,0.7184,0.171,0.829,0.0,pp47
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp47
Well  thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp47
So uh  please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp48
Uh  well  I go to MIT.,0.2732,0.296,0.704,0.0,pp48
I'm a senior right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
And I'll be graduating [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp48
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Uh  to me a leader is somebody who takes initiative  and like creates a vision when they're given a blank slate.,0.6808,0.268,0.732,0.0,pp48
Uh  when  when I think somebody is a leader they  they don't have to be told what's done  or what needs to get done.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
And they form the infinite choices and possibilities can quickly pick up two or three  and make a decision.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
And also like get other people excited about it and organized.,0.5994,0.353,0.647,0.0,pp48
Very good.,0.4927,0.762,0.238,0.0,pp48
Uh  do you think you're a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Give me an example of a time you were on a team  and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,pp48
How did you overcome that?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Hum  Oh yeah.,0.296,0.524,0.476,0.0,pp48
Obviously I do think I'm a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
I'm trying to think of an example.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
One specific challenge.,0.0772,0.394,0.606,0.0,pp48
The uh  for the [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
project you do as a senior.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
We had to ah  my group was in charge of analysing the materials  and we  of the section that I got asigned was  was ah  within our team we did like a self ah  splitting it up.,0.3612,0.065,0.935,0.0,pp48
And I got like a way way heavy load  and somebodies got to really like move.,0.6478,0.274,0.726,0.0,pp48
So it was like pretty  I didn't know if I should talk to somebody else about it or something like that.,0.8158,0.32,0.68,0.0,pp48
And I decided like if we were going to do it as a team.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,pp48
Then we're going to have to be on the same page.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
So at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly.,0.3182,0.126,0.874,0.0,pp48
That's very good.,0.4927,0.615,0.385,0.0,pp48
So uh  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
To never have to sleep.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Like realistically?,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp48
Is this like ah... Yeah something  something that you need to improve upon.,0.765,0.432,0.568,0.0,pp48
I vote to not being able to sleep as well  but unfortunately... Not going to answer things like that.,0.1779,0.201,0.669,0.13,pp48
Uh  I would like to teleport as well  but uh... Uh  definitely to be more organized.,0.705,0.345,0.655,0.0,pp48
So a lot of time I'll get like  my notes will get messy  and stuff like that.,0.3612,0.233,0.651,0.116,pp48
Organization.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
I've been working on it  but it's not where it needs to be.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Very good.,0.4927,0.762,0.238,0.0,pp48
That's a problem that afflicts us all.,-0.4019,0.0,0.69,0.31,pp48
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp48
Uh  so do you have a job you'd like to have?,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,pp48
Do you have in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
I do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp48
So can you tell us why you deserve this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
Uh  cause I work well with other groups  and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things.,0.7506,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp48
Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
And a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative  but it's not like bureaucratic.,0.1116,0.159,0.737,0.103,pp48
Hum.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
So  so this is like the perfect environment  and uh  and I have like some experience in the area.,0.8387,0.359,0.641,0.0,pp48
But more importantly like I  I figure things out and get them done.,0.7939,0.391,0.609,0.0,pp48
Like as they need to be  so people don't have to tell me what to do  or watch over me and stuff like that.,0.6124,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp48
Like it's  if I want something to be accomplished like we'll work with a team to get it done.,0.802,0.38,0.62,0.0,pp48
Without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever.,-0.2755,0.0,0.791,0.209,pp48
Oh well thank you.,0.5574,0.697,0.303,0.0,pp48
I appreciate you coming here today for this interview.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,pp48
Yup.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp48
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp49
Well good.,0.6124,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp49
It's been a tough week.,-0.128,0.0,0.727,0.273,pp49
Ahaha  I understand.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
So  uh  please tell me a bit about your background.,0.3774,0.223,0.777,0.0,pp49
Uhm  my name is <inaudible> I am Junior in course 20.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Which is Biological Engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
I come from Puerto Rico.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
And... I've been learning a bit more this past year about what I actually want to do in life.,0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,pp49
Right now my main goals are set more towards the medicine side of Bioengineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
So medical devices  biomaterials  tissue engineering  drug delivery  it's what  it's what interests me right now.,0.25,0.118,0.882,0.0,pp49
Uh... it's not set right now that's why I am also tending to go to different research opportunities and different uh... pharmaceutical internships and we'll see what happens from there on.,0.3818,0.08,0.92,0.0,pp49
And I'll be able to focus on one actual path per say.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
So... I think I am leader because I like planning things.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,pp49
I like to gather all the information I have  all the resources I have  and all the uh... basically either group uh... all the group <inaudible> or each contribution from each person  gather them all up and come up with an efficient plan to tackle said problem  or homework  or project  or presentation.,0.3818,0.091,0.862,0.047,pp49
Whichever may be the case.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
I tend to make people give more than... I make them give more than 100% of what the  they  they  the bar that they set themselves at.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
So I feel if I feel that somebody has potential I can notice it and at the same time work with a person to basically exploit that potential to a new maximum.,-0.1027,0.0,0.957,0.043,pp49
At the same way I feel that I am very open to constructive criticism  if somebody feels that I am not doing a great job I am very happy just to sit with them and learn from that experience because it's gonna make me more efficient in the future.,0.2244,0.122,0.772,0.106,pp49
So I feel that just having a set plan from the start to tackle problems  and at the same way editing it and adapting it to every new situation or the feelings of the people you are basically  uh overseeing then that's  uh  a very good approach to everything that we do.,0.1263,0.057,0.895,0.048,pp49
Mhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Very good.,0.4927,0.762,0.238,0.0,pp49
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Can you tell me about a time of you were on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you go about resolving that challenge?,0.4939,0.184,0.816,0.0,pp49
So  uh  teams have been uh very large aspect of my life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Ever since High School I've been a part of the Soccer team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
I continue to do that now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
I've been part of the debate team  and Honor Society which had it's own team for competitions.,0.4939,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp49
But I feel that the biggest challenge right now has been when I am with a team of people that are seniors to me.,0.1154,0.059,0.941,0.0,pp49
So they  they are better prepared  much better informed  and have an arsenal of skills that I have yet to acquire because I just don't have the same level of experience that they have.,0.7717,0.199,0.801,0.0,pp49
So if I am Sophomore  and I've been grouped with Seniors and Juniors of my subject of Engineering class  the difference is very noticeable.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
The difference of level and performance is very noticeable.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
And I try to  basically  give what I can  but I also want to excel at what I can actually move forward to.,0.6652,0.206,0.794,0.0,pp49
So if I feel that I can actually contribute much more than what they're expecting of me  because if I don't have that level of experience what I want to do is get to that level.,0.0772,0.036,0.964,0.0,pp49
So I gotta work harder  push through and get to this level that's basically at the same level as the rest of the group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
So I'll try to work with people  and I'll try to find someone who mentor me through that process.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
And step by step  because the biggest challenge for me  is being alone and tackling it straight  I'll use the other group members  I'll readily approach them and ask for help because that's what the group is for.,0.4404,0.141,0.811,0.048,pp49
The team succeeds together all the way.,0.4939,0.348,0.652,0.0,pp49
So... that's I go.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
I would say  doubting.,-0.34,0.0,0.556,0.444,pp49
Doubting myself  doubting the things I do  doubting the decisions I make.,-0.7351,0.0,0.556,0.444,pp49
I would like to have absolutely no regrets  or if I have them learn something from them.,0.6347,0.306,0.694,0.0,pp49
I am sometimes am fairly a safe player  so I calculate the risks before I see the return.,0.2023,0.138,0.762,0.1,pp49
So I'm not a great fan of plunging in into something that I don't know  that's high risk  high return.,-0.7473,0.0,0.698,0.302,pp49
I like to play it safe  and have a thing to fall back on.,0.7783,0.415,0.585,0.0,pp49
The same way it works for problems  it works for personal life  it works for basically everything that's surrounds me.,-0.4019,0.0,0.876,0.124,pp49
I feel that it's been changing  with every new experience I've been passing through.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Leaving home  college outside of Puerto Rico  but I still feel that I'll rarely benefit of just letting go  and taking more of a risk than I normally do.,-0.7404,0.0,0.812,0.188,pp49
That's an interesting thought  thank you.,0.6369,0.565,0.435,0.0,pp49
So now  uh  think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp49
Do you have one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
The first one that pops right into mind is... Bioengineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Okay  so  why do you think we should hire you for this job?,0.2263,0.137,0.863,0.0,pp49
So I've always been naturally curious about things.,0.3182,0.247,0.753,0.0,pp49
I've always had  a drive behind everything I do  so I got into Bioengineering right after I saw that I had this opportunity coming to MIT  and coming from a family that has been effected by a lot of cancer  I found that doing this I could actually benefit my family  benefit other people's families that have been effected by it.,0.5927,0.131,0.807,0.062,pp49
I've been going through some really tough times with grandmothers  and other family members that have survived and succumbed to it.,0.3626,0.137,0.789,0.074,pp49
And from there my motivation has been always to push forward no matter what the challenge.,0.3871,0.208,0.731,0.06,pp49
So when I step into a lab  I see what I have in front of me  the ultimate goal might be the farthest goal in my life  I may never reach it but rest assured that I will do my best to contribute to its forward movement.,0.8754,0.167,0.814,0.019,pp49
I will always try and leave it at a better place than it was before  and if I am not the one to reach it  another person will but I will be sure that I actually contributed to it.,0.5927,0.141,0.832,0.026,pp49
Mhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp49
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp49
So  please tell me about your background.,0.3804,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp5
Alright so  my background  I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and  umm  I've also done research in the computer science field.,0.25,0.083,0.917,0.0,pp5
Umm  I interned  er  I researched with a group at MIT and what we did was we made an interactive game to  uh  to teach.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
And I've also had some experience  uh  internship at  uh  at Google.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Oh  that's all very cool.,0.3804,0.393,0.607,0.0,pp5
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp5
So  uh  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
I think I'm a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
I do believe I have leadership  uh  qualities and that  and I can support this because I've been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus.,0.4019,0.097,0.903,0.0,pp5
And when I have had the responsibilities I've carried them out  uh  very well and I've been able to overcome challenges such as umm  one of the groups I'm  uh  on the executive board of expedited access to standard education.,0.4005,0.089,0.911,0.0,pp5
Umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
And I took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past.,0.6486,0.175,0.825,0.0,pp5
Ah  that's excellent.,0.5719,0.649,0.351,0.0,pp5
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp5
Oh  well I definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh  my participation in my team in are student association Mhmm.,0.5859,0.161,0.839,0.0,pp5
And for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish  I was in charge and I thought I'd give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that I set  so  um  as leader to be responsible for that task  I tried to figure out what was going on in the other students' lives because I was getting context and uh  understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didn't have a lot of tests or homework that week.,0.4404,0.054,0.923,0.023,pp5
And through that  ahem  through that understanding I was able to  um  help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict.,0.6808,0.271,0.651,0.079,pp5
Ah  that's all very good.,0.4927,0.444,0.556,0.0,pp5
Uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
One thing about myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Interesting.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp5
If I was given the option to change one thing about myself  yes?,0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,pp5
Mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp5
What I would change is to  uh  I guess  uh  just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than I  than a person at my level would  you know  at this kind of level  and that's umm  that's something that would be nice.,0.4215,0.06,0.94,0.0,pp5
You know I feel like I would be able to be uh  much further along in my career than I am now.,0.3612,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp5
There's always more that we can learn.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Uh huh  yeah.,0.296,0.524,0.476,0.0,pp5
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp5
Well I think I should get the job because I  um  have the skills necessary to complete the  the task that I'll be assigned.,0.2732,0.084,0.916,0.0,pp5
Um I'm very motivated  I'm always willing to learn and I  I'm very passionate about learning and uh  I think I'll be able to learn a lot through the position  as well as contribute to the position and be able to  um  influence the people that I work directly with or that are shareholders in my project.,0.8437,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp5
Well thank you!,0.5983,0.83,0.17,0.0,pp5
How are ya?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Very well  thanks.,0.6779,0.848,0.152,0.0,pp50
Ah  good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp50
So  please tell me about your background.,0.3804,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp50
My background...uh  I have a fiarly technical background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
I went to a fairly technical high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Um  I have mainly a mathematics and physics background with also some computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Uh  I also  I have been involved in leadership  uh  outside of  outside of academics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
So then in high school I was  uh  captain of my chess team  and I also served as president of a couple of clubs in high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
So I have some  some experience in that regard.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Like I said  mainly I have a pretty quantitative technical background and  uh  with some sprinkling of other stuff as well.,0.7783,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp50
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp50
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Yes  I think so  because I typically think using my own mind and I act on those decisions rather than listening to what...uh  I mean  of course  I take into account what... I think it was Lincoln who said that  uh  you should take into account what people tell you but then make your own decision.,0.2144,0.033,0.967,0.0,pp50
He said it more elaborately  but those are the essence of what he was saying  and I try to  I try to  to use that in every day life and in  also in  like important projects.,0.6652,0.138,0.862,0.0,pp50
I would say that  and I  I usually have  I'm usually pretty successful in convincing people that my way is right when it is.,0.8658,0.316,0.684,0.0,pp50
Hmm  that makes sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Can you give me an example when there was a conflict in a team that you were on  and how you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.093,0.824,0.082,pp50
Um  yeah  I think so.,0.296,0.355,0.645,0.0,pp50
Uh  when its a matter of ideology I don't like to make compromises  but when it's a matter of  uh  getting stuff done  I think that I  I think that I am a team player.,-0.0913,0.062,0.895,0.043,pp50
I think that uh  usually I'm   I'm willing to  to make sacrifices if necessary for the ultimate goal.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
And so  for example  uh  one time in high school  uh  we had a group project  and one of the member  I mean  it was more complicated than I'm making it  but the gist of it was that one of the members who was responsible for our data analysis  he fell short  he  uh  he  we found out pretty late  uh  just a few days before the presentation  that he had misdone most of the data analysis  and as a result  the rest of us  but especially me  because it was a group of four  and we were kind of divided into two  him and me  and then subdivided into ones.,0.8047,0.062,0.938,0.0,pp50
So he and I were kind of a subgroup of a larger group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
And so I was more responsible for what he had done than the other two were.,0.3804,0.147,0.853,0.0,pp50
So it was mainly me  with some help from the other two.,0.4019,0.197,0.803,0.0,pp50
We had to put in a lot of work in those last few days  especially me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
I had to fix that and try to get it  you know  get it functional before the presentation was due.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Ah  very good.,0.4927,0.615,0.385,0.0,pp50
So uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself   what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
And why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
(One thing about myself...) I guess maybe being  uh  being more decisive on incomplete information.,0.2944,0.135,0.865,0.0,pp50
I have a tendency to try to make  to try to get almost perfect information before I commit a hundred percent to a decision  and  of course  that's never  that's not always possible.,0.6815,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp50
And so I do  I mean I do  of course  make decisions based on imperfect information every day.,-0.3182,0.0,0.881,0.119,pp50
You have to  otherwise you wouldn't survive.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
But I feel that  you know  if there is a spectrum of  of how decisive you're willing to be based on a certain amount of information  I think the ideal place that I would like to be is a little further toward the  the decisive on incomplete information end than where I am right now.,0.9349,0.233,0.767,0.0,pp50
So  I would shift that a little bit.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
That makes a lot of sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
So  uh  now think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp50
ok Do you have one in mind?,0.296,0.268,0.732,0.0,pp50
Umm  I mean  let's go with quantitative trading  trading.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Cool.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp50
So  uh  why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
Well I think I have the necessary skill set  and the  and the  not the personality  maybe well personality  but more the  uh  so in terms of skill set  you know  it takes a very quantitative mathematical background with the ability to implement stuff  uh  to program and so on  and I have all of that.,0.6187,0.102,0.898,0.0,pp50
It takes a lot of modelling skills.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
I have that  mathematical modelling and what not.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp50
It also requires you to be A   very competitive  which I have been  and B  to be willing to  you know  to go through hell for  for certain periods of time when you're either up next to a deadline or something unexpected happens and... So it requires you to be able to  to vary the amount of time you put in  usually I'll opt for the higher  uh for an increased amount of time  a significant bit from the average  so I  and I think I have a lot of experience doing that and its something that I've shown I can handle.,0.101,0.073,0.885,0.042,pp50
Well thank you for coming.,0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,pp50
I appreciate you coming for this interview.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp50
Please tell me a bit about your background.,0.3182,0.247,0.753,0.0,pp52
Um  well Im from Florida.,0.2732,0.344,0.656,0.0,pp52
I was born in Miami.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
My  uh  parents are from...I'm  uh  South Korean by ethnicity.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
I'd say I'm more American by heritage but uh  my  um  parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
And around  I was born  like around 90s I was born here in Florida.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,pp52
I had all my schooling in Florida.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
I went to home school until 7th grade then private school until I graduated.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
That's a brief synopsis of my background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp52
Welcome.,0.4588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp52
So  uh  do you think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
I think I am  uh  just because  um  I have seniority maybe through sports or if it's from...I feel like it's hard for people not to be leaders especially when you're um  assigned to do group work or you're assigned to do goal setting.,0.2732,0.054,0.915,0.031,pp52
I feel like if you're in any  uh  situation where you're doing goal setting you're being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them.,0.3612,0.077,0.923,0.0,pp52
And how you tell  like  you're telling yourself  How am I gonna get this done.,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp52
So like  basically you're self leading.,0.4201,0.358,0.642,0.0,pp52
I believe.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
Um  maybe I'd say through sports I was probably a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
By  um  me being the upperclassman  I led my teammates on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
So I'd say  yeah  I've been a leader.,0.3535,0.26,0.74,0.0,pp52
Very good.,0.4927,0.762,0.238,0.0,pp52
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
Can you give me an example of a conflict that you experienced on a team and how you resolved it?,-0.1531,0.077,0.818,0.105,pp52
Uh  yes  um.,0.4019,0.574,0.426,0.0,pp52
SO  seeing how I rowed four years  I think the biggest conflict was um  when  um  Junior year I was rowing for Junior Eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals.,0.1779,0.083,0.854,0.063,pp52
ANd the last  pentameter of the terameter (sp) race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals.,-0.3182,0.087,0.787,0.125,pp52
That was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing  especially because that's something I spent four hours a day  six days a week on for my entire senior  um  high school career and that twas something I was going to carry over through to college.,-0.1761,0.0,0.971,0.029,pp52
And what really um  made me realize was that yes  like  that was a big mistake  it was just  honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it weren't for some people  if it weren't for just me  just being  just taking and it and just maturing from it  I think that's like  what it takes.,0.7311,0.141,0.831,0.027,pp52
If you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it.,0.2508,0.191,0.674,0.135,pp52
You can still push something onto the table.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
Like  um  last  last (?),0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0,pp52
year and still work hard to  to really fight through it.,-0.5095,0.0,0.677,0.323,pp52
You can really become great.,0.6573,0.523,0.477,0.0,pp52
And um  I feel like that's what I was really working to change my view on that and um  in the end we  um  we medaled  we  uh  were runner ups in states.,0.3612,0.072,0.928,0.0,pp52
We medaled.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
So  I think that was a  good  good conflict that I resolved.,0.6369,0.421,0.449,0.129,pp52
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp52
I imagine that would have been a very difficult situation.,-0.4201,0.0,0.763,0.237,pp52
It was pretty tough.,0.4019,0.478,0.299,0.224,pp52
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
I wish  I wish...If I could change one thing about myself I think it would be me being  I think  more proactive to do something.,0.6997,0.201,0.799,0.0,pp52
I'd say  I wish I was more...I wish I was could  I wish I was a little bit more volatile in things I chose  actually.,0.7964,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp52
Because I feel like um  I stuck to just doing crew in high school and I thought that was great but I was wondering  like  I wondered what would happen to me if I tried different  more than one thing.,0.7227,0.168,0.799,0.033,pp52
I know  I know like it's good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field.,0.6597,0.221,0.779,0.0,pp52
But I always wondered  I always wondered like  what would happen if I pursued more toward research or more towards um  club activities.,0.5023,0.129,0.871,0.0,pp52
That way I could have like  a more well-rounded high school experience.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp52
So  now thinking about a job you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp52
Okay  you have one in mind?,0.2263,0.275,0.725,0.0,pp52
One right now or just... The one you interview for.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
So  why do you think you should have this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
Well  I think I should have this job mainly because I find that I'm well with groups  I work very well with groups.,0.6801,0.248,0.752,0.0,pp52
At the same time when you push me to do tasks myself I'm able to do the same amount  be just as productive.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp52
I feel like  um  as an applicant being subject to group work and individual work  um  there should be no difference in how I should produce something in group work in individual work.,0.0772,0.07,0.868,0.062,pp52
I should be just as creative and innovative if I was working myself or if I was spending time working with a group of people.,0.7003,0.201,0.799,0.0,pp52
So  I feel like if I was going to get this job  um  it would help greatly for the people I'd be working with and for myself.,0.6666,0.179,0.821,0.0,pp52
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp52
Appreciate your coming in to interview today.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp52
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
I'm fine How are you ?,0.2023,0.265,0.735,0.0,pp53
Good  tell me more about your backround.,0.4404,0.326,0.674,0.0,pp53
Uhmm  so  I was born in uh  Nigeria uh  and I actually came  over to the united states when I was 8 years old.,0.4215,0.109,0.891,0.0,pp53
uhmm and uhm basically like most of my family members are actually not in the medical field so  it was kind like  I actually don't know what got my initial interest in the medical field.,0.8925,0.273,0.727,0.0,pp53
mhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
But uh  I remember science  math  math and science were always my best subjects.,0.7783,0.309,0.691,0.0,pp53
Uhm and I really enjoy anatomy  human anatomy.,0.5413,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp53
Uhm  so I think that's when i started thinking about medical field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  and uhm after being able to shadow uhm a neonatologist in high school  I think that's when I kind of figured  this  like i want to work in pediatrics  and plus I love kids as well.,0.8582,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp53
That's when I really figured out that's  what I wanted to do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
mmhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp53
Could I get you to scoot over a little bit?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Left-right?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
left  there you go.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
I do beleive I'm a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  I do beleive I take initiative a lot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  one example that is uhm one of the student groups that I work with  I work with several actually  but one of uhm  an example from one  the one that I work  with is our black women alliance.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  I'm on the executive board.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
But my role is pretty uh  It's kind of almost in the shadows.,0.6486,0.264,0.736,0.0,pp53
Uh I'm on the social committee.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
So I'm the representative for my class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
uhm  and uhm  I tend to kind of like  I guess because I'm more of an upperclassmen I can tend to just throw ideas and get people thinking uhm rather then you know  I guess direct people.,0.2975,0.058,0.942,0.0,pp53
I think I'm more of like an  Initiator uhm   then I let people ya know just do what they want with whatever it is they throw out there.,0.4728,0.136,0.864,0.0,pp53
Yes  I do believe I am a leader.,0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0,pp53
Okay  and do you consider yourself a team player?,0.2263,0.192,0.808,0.0,pp53
Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it?,-0.1531,0.081,0.81,0.11,pp53
Um  yes i do beleive I'm a team player.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,pp53
Uh  another student that I work with  I work with several that I can mention.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  are black student union and I'm on the executive board of  for the second time this year  uhm and Im co-chair uhm this year and uhm  our executive board is pretty unique.,0.4939,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp53
Uhm even though I havent titled in co-chair  uhm  every member on the e-board has a really even role.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
So it's really even split as far as like what we have  uhm  our responsibilities are  and how much our opinions weigh.,0.3612,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp53
uhm  and um  actually this current executive voard we had some rocky start at the beginning of the year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
uhm  there was a lot of loss of communication  uhm things weren't getting done in a timely fashion.,-0.3182,0.0,0.881,0.119,pp53
We weren't really making progress.,-0.3691,0.0,0.612,0.388,pp53
uhm   collectively.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Individually we were fine but collectively we weren't really moving forward.,0.1027,0.123,0.877,0.0,pp53
Uhm  But Uhm  we  A few of us noticed that fact that  we werent communicating and uhm  we actually thought it would be a good idea to kind of have like a  like a  de-breifing session where we kind of express  you know  what is wrong exactlly.,0.7351,0.18,0.748,0.072,pp53
Uhm  and how we can move forward and we found out that ya know that we have to find a way to kind of communicate more even if its just sending a breif text every now and then saying what you are doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm  We should definitely communicate more often then we were doing.,0.4019,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp53
And uh yes  we've been able to communicate more  more then some  we definitely  we definitely have a  long way to go but we're increasing communication uh  right now and uh  we're doing much better.,0.8126,0.233,0.767,0.0,pp53
And we're making a lot of progress now.,0.4215,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp53
that's uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
If I was given one option to change one thing about myself  Uh  I think it would be my hesitation.,-0.2732,0.0,0.9,0.1,pp53
Uhm  Im pretty hesitant uhm about you know uhm  first ideas or initial thoughts that I have.,0.296,0.158,0.743,0.099,pp53
Uhm I like always have to seek like a second opinion.,0.6124,0.357,0.643,0.0,pp53
Or  I'll have to talk it out with someone or  sometimes I don't even talk about it all because um  I get maybe shy.,-0.25,0.0,0.92,0.08,pp53
I wouldn't exactly call myself shy but I guess when it comes to some opinions I might have i'm really  hesitant about sharing.,0.167,0.144,0.701,0.156,pp53
Uhm  and that's one thing I'd definitely like to change because some  most of the time people say oh your idea was actually really cool.,0.7778,0.262,0.738,0.0,pp53
And I'm just like 'wow really'?,0.743,0.612,0.388,0.0,pp53
So I guess I kind of doubt myself a lot.,-0.4201,0.0,0.763,0.237,pp53
I think that's something that I'd really like to change.,0.4201,0.237,0.763,0.0,pp53
Because it hinders me a lot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
Uhm I would really  I think it's something I need to work on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp53
And I guess uhm  A way to improve that would again  doing more of the talking to people about how they feel about my idea.,0.4404,0.108,0.892,0.0,pp53
They think it's a good idea uhm and it has helped a little bit in the past but I need to work on that some more.,0.2382,0.072,0.928,0.0,pp53
Great  and why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.6249,0.272,0.728,0.0,pp53
I think I should get into medical school  uhm  because I do believe that I will make a good doctor.,0.4404,0.132,0.868,0.0,pp53
um  I'm a people person I love helping people.,0.7506,0.478,0.522,0.0,pp53
um  and I love kids um I love seeing um I guess their resilience when it comes to  their health.,0.8555,0.318,0.682,0.0,pp53
Um how they can just um  ya know  get better so quickly compared to adults.,0.4404,0.172,0.828,0.0,pp53
um and I want to I guess   um bring the knowledge that i gained from MIT um into the medical fiwld.,0.4404,0.17,0.83,0.0,pp53
Um  whether it's through  ya know  drugs  different drug discoveries and things like that and drug trials.,0.3612,0.135,0.865,0.0,pp53
Or um  even if it's just ya know  um kind of like the collaborative spirit we have at MIT campus  bringing it to a hospital setting.. setting  uhm because I know a lot of hospitals have just like a barrier between uh doctors and nurses  or doctors and patients  so uhm I feel like that's an attribute that I bring take around the world  kind of  and into a hosptial setting to alleviate situations like that.,0.8363,0.138,0.844,0.018,pp53
Ready?,0.3612,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp55
Yeah  sure.,0.5423,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp55
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
Ummm  I'm great.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,pp55
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp55
OK Tell me a bit about your background OK well I am a math major  but I have a lot of background in kind of different areas.,0.5397,0.186,0.814,0.0,pp55
So freshman year I did some work  um  at the Department of Energy  um  working the CFO's office so I'm getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices.,0.0,0.061,0.877,0.061,pp55
Then I kinda branched more towards CS aspects  so  I did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also  um  for companies.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp55
And do you think you are a leader  and why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
Ummm  definitely.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,pp55
So I'm president of The Undergrad Society of Learner Math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to  um  kind of help underclassmen and  also  younger girls  so those in highschool  middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events  even networking things  so  uh  anything with companies but also research with professors.,0.7311,0.118,0.882,0.0,pp55
It's a great way to kind of help other people who haven't really seen those opportunities yet.,0.8545,0.401,0.599,0.0,pp55
And do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
Can you give an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it?,-0.1531,0.085,0.8,0.115,pp55
Yeah  soum  last winter I was working in the Boston area at Autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up.,0.5719,0.198,0.802,0.0,pp55
um   I don't know how much familiarity you have with  um  coding like repository systems  but  basically if someone  um  uploads like their work to the server and it doesn't work basically everyone elses stuff doesn't work either.,0.6124,0.122,0.878,0.0,pp55
So there's like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people.,-0.3214,0.096,0.727,0.176,pp55
So every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyone's work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code.,-0.7184,0.041,0.819,0.14,pp55
So it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake.,0.128,0.124,0.773,0.103,pp55
And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
I guess I would probably try to ask more questions.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
Um  in general if I get directions which are really broad where I don't know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
I guess it would be good to get more like to the point.,0.6901,0.341,0.659,0.0,pp55
And why do you think you should get the job Um like I mentioned before i think I have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities.,0.8176,0.253,0.747,0.0,pp55
In addition to this I am pretty qualified I believe in terms of my academic classes that I have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated I have a deep passion for math.,0.7351,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp55
And aside from that  I have many internships which have honed my skills in the work place.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp55
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp56
I'm doing well  um  tell me more about your background.,0.2732,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp56
Um  I'm currently a junior at MIT studying Biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
I'm interested in going to medical school  so I'm hoping to apply to medical school my senior year  and then matriculate the next year.,0.6983,0.208,0.792,0.0,pp56
Um  yeah.,0.296,0.688,0.312,0.0,pp56
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp56
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Um  I think I'm a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
I have a lot of leadership positions  so  currently I am the President of the student group at MIT called the American Medical Student Association.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
So  uh  I help organize a lot of events for pre-meds at MIT  um  so as a pre-med I feel there aren't very many resources  um  for pre-meds.,0.4522,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp56
We have a pre-med advising office  but  um  most students at MIT end up going into like  Engineering or Research  not very many go into medicine.,0.5023,0.115,0.885,0.0,pp56
So  um  we provide a lot of  um  outside activities for pre-meds.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Uh  our main one is  um  lecture series  so we often ask Doctors from nearby hospitals to come speak about  like  what they do.,0.3612,0.098,0.902,0.0,pp56
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp56
And do you consider a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Can you give me an example if there was a conflict in your team  and your aim to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp56
Sure  um  so  um  as part of the 'American Medical Student Association'  uh  last year we started a brand new event  um  it was a 5k run to benefit the Austins Childrens Hospital.,0.6486,0.146,0.854,0.0,pp56
And since it was our first time planning such a large event we had a lot of trouble  um  like  communicating between team members and distributing um  what  like clearly stating what each person should do  and what their responsibilities were.,0.6124,0.162,0.781,0.057,pp56
Um  to fix that I think we had to like  I had to call  like  an Executive meeting.,0.6124,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp56
So  we have an Exec Board and then  uh  I made sure that everyone knew clearly what they were supposed to do  and made sure they finished what they had to do by a certain date.,0.8126,0.227,0.773,0.0,pp56
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp56
And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Hmm  that's tough.,-0.128,0.0,0.571,0.429,pp56
(Laughter) Um  I think the main thing I would try to change is  um  getting nervous in front of strangers or being shy  um  I used to  um  get really shy when  like  public speaking for example  speaking in front of a lot of people  and I've been trying to improve that.,0.5378,0.145,0.751,0.104,pp56
Um  but  I think it would be nice if I could be more  but like  there is still room for improvement.,0.9075,0.387,0.613,0.0,pp56
I see.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
And why do you think you should get into Medical School?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
Uh  my passion is helping people.,0.6369,0.565,0.435,0.0,pp56
So  I have a lot of  I've been doing a lot of volunteer activities  um  I've been volunteering at hospitals  I've been volunteering at Brooks  I bring them to the Womens Hospital in Boston  and MEPS General Hospital.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp56
I've also been volunteering through the Cambridge Community Centers  I used to tutor young children how to read  and I'm currently an AP Biology Teacher for  um  students in the Boston area  who want to take AP Biology  but can't.,0.0387,0.029,0.971,0.0,pp56
Um  so  I really enjoy helping people  uh  and I think medicine is one of the best ways to help people because everyone gets sick and  uh  I mean once your health is gone you can't really do anything  so...,0.87,0.255,0.68,0.064,pp56
How you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
I'm doing very well today.,0.3384,0.374,0.626,0.0,pp57
Thanks.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp57
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp57
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
I'm currently a Junior here at MIT and I'm pursing a double major in Computer Science and Management um the reason for that is that I actually fell in love with um the merging of computer science with a lot of other fields and I found that management is a way to take computer science and the theories of algorithms and problem solving and taking it to a wider field which is exactly why I'm interested in consulting is again its the idea of taking problem solving and algorithms and applying it to a lot of different problems and always trying new things and I'm very excited about that and that's where I'm coming from Great!,0.893,0.14,0.799,0.06,pp57
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
I do.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
Um  I'm actually a part of the Gordan Engineering leadership program here at MIT  which students are chosen through an application  process to be a part of this program  and in this program um  we work on engineering leadership labs which is um  they give us scenarios which we might encounter in the real world and we take the position of a leader and kind of get to step through it  and I've gotten very positive feedback from my group every time about how I've handled those.,0.5984,0.043,0.957,0.0,pp57
In addition  in um various activities I'm involved in on campus I have had a leadership role in many of those and again I've gotten very positive feedback from the people I've worked with so I think those put together mean not only have I had the experience to be a leader but I've also had positive feedback that I am succeeding at that.,0.9126,0.16,0.84,0.0,pp57
Great!,0.6588,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp57
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp57
Definitely!,0.4574,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp57
Um  I was on the committee that designed our class ring so at MIT each year there's a new class ring designed specifically for that year and the idea is that it enco..encompasses aspects of all different fractions of student life so this committee is made up of a very diverse group of people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
And um  there were some features on the ring which we would become very divided on and there few ah divisions within campus which kind of became clear on our team  so people would kind of polarize based on which side of the campus fraction they lived on and then it would kind of get a little bit hostile  and people would say this is relevant  no it's not relevant  um and I kind of became the peace keeper um where I would kind of go between those sides try to find the mutually agreeable thing maybe like if someone really wanted something on the ring and someone else didn't I would suggest maybe we could make it smaller or have it somewhere else so if it was on the ring but not so blatantly obvious that the people who didn't relate to it thought it was too focal  so I became kind of the unofficial go between who would hear both sides kind of impartially and put things together...and I had about 2 to 3 people afterwards tell me that we wouldn't have gotten to where we did without my peacekeeping.,0.0565,0.039,0.929,0.033,pp57
That's great  alright!,0.75,0.865,0.135,0.0,pp57
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
I think I would know my limits a little bit better.,0.3862,0.208,0.792,0.0,pp57
Um  in that sense I  like I mentioned with the computer science and management I get excited in a lot of different areas and I really want to try doing everything that excites me and I really give it my all  but as a result being involved with a lot of different things means that at times I very tired because I'm trying to do a lot so I think I would recognize when I'm hitting that point and scale back a little bit um that said  I've been trying to work on that a bit this year and kind of pick my top activities and cut down to those so it is something I'm working on.,-0.2366,0.071,0.873,0.055,pp57
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp57
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp57
I think aside from my background which is as I mentioned very ah relevant to consulting with the library and gym applications  um as we've talked about I'm very much a team player  I'm very excited about the work that you do um  I absolutely love all the different aspects  I've talked to a lot of people in the company and I've really liked what they've said about the company culture  it makes me very excited and those are all values I struggle and relate to  so in addition to the expertise I think I would be a great fit.,0.9637,0.191,0.789,0.02,pp57
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp58
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp58

I study ocean engineering at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
I’m a junior and I’m really interested in building robots to use in the ocean.,0.4576,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp58
Like  this summer I worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in Antarctica.,0.3612,0.143,0.857,0.0,pp58
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp58
Um  do you think you’re a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Yes  I believe I’m a leader.,0.4019,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp58
Right now  um  one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the Society of Naval Architects Submarine Engineers at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
And that’s a group of all the ocean engineers studying at MIT including undergrads and grad-students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
And  um  I’m working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with  with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments.,0.4019,0.101,0.899,0.0,pp58
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team that you had to resolve?,0.0772,0.104,0.803,0.092,pp58
Yes  I’d say I’m a team player.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp58
Uhm  this  this term I’m working on a team for one of my classes.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
A team of about seven people and we’re building  er  manufacturing a hundred yo-yos together and  um  it’s actually complicated to manufacture one yo-yo if you’re doing everything from scratch like the molds  the plastic  the process times  you figuring out which missions you want to use.,0.4215,0.078,0.922,0.0,pp58
And  um  we’ve done a yo-yo  we decided to divide our team into  um  groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yo-yo so we have four parts.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
And we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yo-yos but two teams hadn’t finished their part yet because they couldn’t  um  get time in the mission shop  so we decided to resolve that by  we talked to the professor  I was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening.,0.3716,0.045,0.931,0.024,pp58
Uhm  we got the extention  and anyway  if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then  the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week.,-0.296,0.0,0.942,0.058,pp58
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp58
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Let’s see.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Sometimes  I would like to be more comfortable with my voice.,0.7264,0.404,0.596,0.0,pp58
Like speaking louder and more confidently.,0.7089,0.596,0.404,0.0,pp58
Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Sometimes  like when I go back home I pick up this southern accent again.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,pp58
My family lives in D.C.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when I came home for Thanksgiving I had this southern twang.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Oh  it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then I went into this middle stage  now I’m back to where I am now.,-0.2551,0.0,0.928,0.072,pp58
Maybe speaking a little bit more quieter  but without the accent.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
So I need to find out where my voice is.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp58
So  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Uhm  I am a really hard worker  I’m very organized  I’m comfortable working with teams.,0.4349,0.195,0.712,0.093,pp58
I’m also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that I’m involved on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp58
Um  I’m passionate about what I do and I can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group.,0.5267,0.145,0.855,0.0,pp58
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp59
Great  hahaha.,0.8271,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp59
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp59
More about my backround  well... I'm from Canada  but I grew up in South Florida because  you know  one day my parents just decided that it was too cold *interviewer laughs* so they literally just decided to pick up and move.,0.705,0.13,0.87,0.0,pp59
Uhh  so I basically lived there my whole life until I decided to come here for school  and  you know  since then I've just been going through MIT... I'm trying to do a lot of pre-med things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp59
I like to volunteer.,0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0,pp59
Uhhh  you know  strong family values  things like that.,0.8176,0.586,0.414,0.0,pp59
So... Great!,0.6588,0.815,0.185,0.0,pp59
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp59
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp59
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp59
Because  umm  everything I try to do  I  you know  always try to do the best that I can  and  even if I'm not the best at it  that-- the effort  like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody  even if they're better at it than I am  you know.,0.8243,0.199,0.719,0.082,pp59
I find that's inspiring  you know  seeing someone try  you know  and trying their hardest.,0.4215,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp59
And maybe they're not the best at it but  you know  the effort that they put into something  is sort of something to be looked high upon  so... Okay  okay  and do you consider yourself a team player?,0.3645,0.112,0.836,0.052,pp59
Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.104,0.803,0.092,pp59
*hushed laughter* Umm  sure.,0.6705,0.733,0.267,0.0,pp59
Sooo  basically almost every night when you go home to problem set... You know  problems sets here are sort of designed to be group efforts  at least in chemical engineering they are  and often you and your group are working and you come to a crossroads  you know  part of the group thinks you should go one wan and part of the gorup things we should go another way.,-0.6597,0.0,0.925,0.075,pp59
And  you know  kind of something that I've learned is that you can't shut down other people's ideas... Umm  so  I think something really important to do is... WE end up trying both ways  and maybe it takes us a little blt more effot  and maybe it takes us a little bit longer  but then we know for sure  like  you know  Okay  this way definitely didn't work  and you know maybe this way is the better way to go... but at least we didn't just  you know  diverge one way  and think like Oh  maybe we should have done it another way  so I think that's pretty important.,0.9782,0.214,0.786,0.0,pp59
If you were given the opportunity to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.4215,0.157,0.843,0.0,pp59
Umm  hmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp59
I wish I was taller *both laugh*.,0.743,0.558,0.442,0.0,pp59
You know  sometimes  I guess I always think that  you know  I'm right  and  you know  it takes people some convincing and I--I know I'm definitely not right all the time but I think that's kind of  you know  like  human nature  like  no-one ever wants to think that they're wrong   but  uhh  you know something I've learned here is  you're not always right  and everyone here is pretty smart  and they also have some really good ideas  and  it's really important to sort of take into account what others are thinking and  you know  that's just sort of the best way to progress  at least in our work here  it's... No-one could ever finish something  for example  the problem sets like I was talking about before  you can't finish a problem set by yourself.,0.9855,0.238,0.716,0.046,pp59
You need to get input from other people  and like  becoming open-minded was definitely  like  a challenge for me  but it's something that I've been working on  and something I think I've definitely got a lot better at since coming to MIT  at least  so... And  why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.8979,0.218,0.782,0.0,pp59
Heh  ha  because I've been working my but off *both laugh* Umm  you know  it's just something that I'm very passionate about.,0.907,0.376,0.582,0.042,pp59
I'm really  not... I would do it for free  like I'm  you know people say they want to do medicine for the money  or you know  'cause it's a high-power career  but you know   it's the only type of thing... and... that I see myself being satisfied with in a long-term career.,0.775,0.154,0.846,0.0,pp59
It's... I love being part of  like  the medical community right now  you know  if it's my work between being an EMT  working at the hospital... you know  working as a tech... These are all things that I would love and I would do.,0.8979,0.21,0.79,0.0,pp59
I'm happy to wake up in the morning and go do these things  and  you know  I wanna say it's like my burning passion like  it is  you know  my drive and  you know  I think that's probably the most important thing when you're looking for a candidate for medical school or for a job.,0.9152,0.216,0.784,0.0,pp59
Umm  it's knowing that  you know  they're not gonna  you know  one day decide that they don't wanna do this anymore  and they're not kind of like Yeah  I'm not sure if I wanna go to med school.,-0.2881,0.053,0.842,0.105,pp59
It's like  no  I've been wanting to do this since I was like  nine years old  and every single thing I've done to work my way towards it... it's just made me fall in love with it even more.,0.7906,0.198,0.754,0.047,pp59
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp59
So please tell me about your background.,0.3804,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp6
Um  so  I was born in Japan  um  where I lived for seven years.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
After that  I moved to uh the U.S.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
when I was around seven or eight years old.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Uh  first to Michigan for a couple of years  from two to three  and then to Maryland um and it was in Maryland that I started middle school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
And  it was through middle school and high school that I was exposed to above average and advanced courses in science  math  and uh programming.,0.1779,0.076,0.875,0.049,pp6
I was competing with I think the best in the state  and probably best in the nation  taking math competitions  just doing a lot of science competitions in general.,0.8555,0.237,0.763,0.0,pp6
Um  junior year of high school  uh  because of peer and parental pressures  I decided to go into premed.,-0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,pp6
And I decided to take  consequently decided to take some bio classes  uh  a lot of cell physiology  genetics  psychology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
And when I got here at MIT  uh well logically I decided to major in course twenty  bio engineering.,0.2732,0.104,0.896,0.0,pp6
Um  and to just to follow that track I decided to take a couple  decided to do a couple internships in labs  four labs actually  two in academia here at MIT actually and I realized that uh the positions weren't fast paced and weren't competitive enough or quantitative enough for that matter  so I decided to go into industry hoping that would satisfy my requirements  I guess.,0.6577,0.097,0.882,0.021,pp6
And again it was fun  I learned a lot  but it was just uh it didn't have the skill set requirements that I wanted.,0.2846,0.085,0.915,0.0,pp6
Uh but it was um my last internship I had the opportunity to talk with several directors  managers  people on the business side  I realized that could be something that I want to do.,0.631,0.139,0.861,0.0,pp6
That could be more appropriate for me  for my career.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Um  afterward I talked to a lot of my finance colleagues  started taking finance classes  went to workshops  started networking  and I realized  you know  this is most likely what I want to do.,0.0772,0.038,0.962,0.0,pp6
I talked to several people who wanted to go into trading and they gave me some interview questions and I said you know what  that's exactly the kind of questions that I want to tackle on a daily basis.,0.0772,0.033,0.967,0.0,pp6
And so that's why I'm here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Do I think I'm a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I believe so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
And this is  I say so because of several reasons.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
One is from  just from personal experience in the past.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I've uh worked in teams  Ive met teams  a few in high school and a few in college  and I think I work well with others.,0.2732,0.077,0.923,0.0,pp6
But not only that  people trust me.,0.6652,0.426,0.574,0.0,pp6
I am able to divide up a huge project  break it down into small sub-projects and uh give  assign these tasks to different people without uh any complaints  without too much complaints.,0.7018,0.19,0.81,0.0,pp6
I think I have some leaderships skills  uh as you can see from my resume if (inaudible mumbling).,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp6
I do consider myself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I'd like to give a good example.,0.6597,0.519,0.481,0.0,pp6
In my sophomore year in high school  I worked with this project called Mission Impossible  or Mission Possible  sorry  and the goal of the project was to design a rover from scratch  that would traverse a platform and record data  send it over to the computer  and the computer will create a 3D graph  a 3D replica of the terrain.,0.2023,0.034,0.945,0.021,pp6
And we were graded on how precise and accurate  how similar the 3D terrain was to the actual terrain.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
And there were many parts to the project  one was the construction of the actual rover.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
The other was the programming.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Making us write the source code.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Third one was making the terrain.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
The forth one was integrating everything together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
There were five group members  there were only four tasks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I was picked to be  I guess the group leader  so I assigned the tasks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I made sure everything integrated correctly.,0.3182,0.315,0.685,0.0,pp6
And  it's not a small task  but uh  it definitely gave me some experience.,0.5499,0.215,0.785,0.0,pp6
I think one of the problems was  because this was a four week long project  this was a four week long project  but we didn't get much done until the third or forth week  because things just didn't integrate correctly.,-0.2144,0.0,0.955,0.045,pp6
There weren't communications  there weren't assigned tasks  there just wasn't teamwork.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
There just wasn't the synergy that was required for us in order for us to finish this project.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
And during the third week I was appointed the captain  I gave tasks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I made sure every part was compatible.,0.3182,0.277,0.723,0.0,pp6
I made sure that everybody knew what everybody else was doing  and in the end we completed the project successfully.,0.6705,0.234,0.766,0.0,pp6
If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what woud you change and why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Well  as you can see from my resume  my biggest weakness I think is my lack of formal training in finance.,-0.4588,0.083,0.714,0.202,pp6
Uh  I'm not a course fifteen finance or management major  or a course fourteen economics major.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I don't have any form of work experience  I don't work in a big bank or investment company or a proprietary trading firm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
But  I can tell you  that I have taken more initiative  I've been more proactive in the last year in terms of looking for ways to combat  to overcome my weakness.,-0.394,0.106,0.719,0.175,pp6
I've gone to network sessions  I've actually set up to quit my sports team so I could go to these network sections  info sessions  workshops  because unfortunately team practice was always between five and seven and that was also the period in which info sessions were held.,-0.34,0.0,0.95,0.05,pp6
I did my research  I've gone online and went to your company website  I know exactly who you guys and what you're looking for  I know exactly what my role will be.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
I don't have any false expectations about my job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
And  after knowing everything  I am still very very very interested in the position.,0.5477,0.214,0.786,0.0,pp6
Why do you think we should hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp6
Well  I  I think my answer to the past question about uh how I overcame at my weakness how one of my strength is  my quantitative competitive and fast paced abilities  and the fact that I don't have any false expectations  I know exactly what I want to do  I know exactly what you want from me.,0.7003,0.18,0.776,0.043,pp6
And  those are very good reasons  like they apply to this.,0.7146,0.398,0.602,0.0,pp6
And I would also like to compare myself with the rest competition and tell you that I have more  I don't think there's anybody else with the same kind of technical strength  technical expertise that I have  um  even uh most students here at MIT.,0.6908,0.117,0.883,0.0,pp6
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp6
Okay  how are you doing today?,0.2263,0.275,0.725,0.0,pp60
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp60
How are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp60
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  so  I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  most of my background is in biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at MIT  in just basic molecular biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  but  I'm also involved in a couple student groups on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
One of them  I was previously involved in MIT Fighting World Hunger  so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues.,-0.4019,0.071,0.763,0.165,pp60
And  right now I've devoted all of my time to a different organization called GlobeMed at MIT  and we basically  our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve HIV healthcare services in Togo  which is in Africa.,0.6808,0.123,0.877,0.0,pp60
Most people don't know where that is  so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Do you think you're a leader and tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I think  uh  if I'm not now I think I have the potential to be one.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  I still consider myself immature as in  I'm still a student  but  I think I have been given a couple of leadership positions that I've grown a lot from  um  and I think if I was given  if I was put in a different situation I could adapt to it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  would you like an example of a... That would be great.,0.765,0.398,0.602,0.0,pp60
Um  so  uh  I'm co-president of the organization I just mentioned  GlobeMed at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
And  we  uh  basically are in charge  me and my fellow co-president are in charge of about 30 other members.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  and this involves a lot of coordination among teams that we have split.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
We've organized our organization into different teams and we've got like campaigns  which is like fundraising team  and we've got communications  is like publicity  finances  and community building  and these are all like split up  at the same time we also have to maintain contact with our partner organization abroad in Togo.,0.8402,0.172,0.828,0.0,pp60
Um  so we do a lot with like non-profit business as well as marketing but also sort of try to appeal to the undergraduate population in terms of fundraising but also awareness.,0.3182,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp60
So it's kind of  pretty multi faceted  I think I've done a lot in terms of building up this organization  it started from scratch essentially  so.,0.4417,0.104,0.896,0.0,pp60
And  if you wanted examples of leaderships I guess I could... the only objective thing would be like what we've accomplished so far  would that be interesting to you?,0.7964,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp60
Mhm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Um  so  uh  so we started this year essentially  and we were able to secure a lot of sponsorships from different companies such as City Sports  Dunkin Donuts  Copy Tech  as well as MIT sponsorships like the public service center  where they would give us about $3000 to do our project in January in Togo.,0.7184,0.119,0.881,0.0,pp60
And  an MIT office donated 62 laptops just this last week.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
So I think  like  we've been definitely doing well like getting our name out there and also  um  achieving what we've set out to do  which is improve healthcare.,0.8993,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp60
Um  well  the project hasn't essentially started but our mission was to provide technology to improve clinical efficiency there.,0.8248,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp60
So  um  having our first step sort of been made by securing these donations I think is a good step of us showing that we have been succeeding objectively  but  but yeah.,0.7579,0.233,0.767,0.0,pp60
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp60
Um  yes  so  I do think I've definitely learned a lot from this experiment  experience  to become more of a team player.,0.6597,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp60
And I think I  uh  I know what it takes to be a good team player  by seeing what doesn't work  what does work  qualities that I don't think work in other members in interactions that I've had.,0.4404,0.073,0.927,0.0,pp60
So  an example would be  uh  last year  when GlobeMed first started  I wasn't the co-president  but we had a set of co-presidents who were also starting out.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
So  to be fair  it was a totally new concept  new organization  and it's  their downfall is they weren't that motivated.,0.0216,0.107,0.79,0.103,pp60
They didn't really seem to care that much about the outcome of our organization.,0.5367,0.21,0.79,0.0,pp60
And for me and other members that really devoted ourselves to it  it really frustrated us  um  but we had to learn how to be team players in the sense that we couldn't just go out and do everything ourselves and risk stepping on their toes.,-0.4588,0.04,0.86,0.1,pp60
We had to respect their position as our bosses essentially.,0.4767,0.256,0.744,0.0,pp60
And this definitely was difficult in a lot of ways  I think I learned that you have to know your bounds and know that you can't achieve everything.,0.0516,0.087,0.833,0.08,pp60
You can't always just brute force your way through things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I think that  um  it's always the best way  if you ever feel like any conflict is about to arise or if you feel uncomfortable at something  like  immediately schedule a time to meet with that person  just talk it out  completely respectfully  without approaching a bunch of people and asking what they think.,0.807,0.187,0.737,0.075,pp60
It's just probably better to meet face to face with that person and settle it from the start.,0.4404,0.146,0.854,0.0,pp60
And then you know if things don't improve after that  there may be other things you can do involving other members  but I think it's best  just face to face  yeah  so much of our world is like by e-mail nowadays  so yeah.,0.9427,0.283,0.687,0.031,pp60
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp60
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
In terms of leadership?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Or  anything?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
In terms of anything.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Oh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Well  my joke would be I wish I was taller  but  hahaha.,0.836,0.553,0.447,0.0,pp60
Well  I wish I was more  I guess I would change  my  like  time management skills.,0.743,0.36,0.64,0.0,pp60
Because I think I definitely am not as efficient as I'd like to be right now  especially as a student.,0.4344,0.212,0.693,0.095,pp60
Um  I think I spend a lot of time on Facebook.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I do a lot of networking  which I think I justify to myself like 'Oh that's good for future endeavors ' but I really think I  like  I could be more efficient in terms of like  you know my free time in the summer  like  learn a new programming language.,0.9699,0.343,0.657,0.0,pp60
Like  that could be  that's always something I wanted to do but never end up doing.,0.1901,0.104,0.896,0.0,pp60
So  so yeah  I would probably change that.,0.4159,0.284,0.716,0.0,pp60
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp60
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
Uh  I think I'm very like motivated.,0.7245,0.548,0.452,0.0,pp60
I think because I know how to act as a leader of a group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I may not be the most experienced in software development since I just started the major.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I think I can direct a team of people very diverse from me and working very different from me because I think I'm a very vocal person.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
I think I communicate well  uh  with people  or attemptfully.,0.2732,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp60
And I think that can be useful when it's a team.,0.4404,0.225,0.775,0.0,pp60
And  I think software development  like a lot of people think  like  it's just one person in a group programming  but I think it really involves a lot of coordination among the team.,0.3612,0.101,0.899,0.0,pp60
I think I can contribute that way.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp60
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
I’m doing well  thank you.,0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,pp61
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp61
Umm  tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
We never met before.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
“Laughs” O ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Umm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
My name is Victoria Mcray (sp) and I’m an Aerospace Engineer at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
I am a Junior and I’m in NRTC (sp) witch is a Naval training program that you take during college to commission as an officer.,-0.3612,0.0,0.906,0.094,pp61
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp61
Umm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Do you think you’re a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
I would say I am a leader in training at this moment.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Umm through ROTC I am put in leadership rolls reach semester.,0.0258,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp61
Which help  ahh  build the skills towards becoming a leader.,0.4019,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp61
“quite white noise” Great.,0.6249,0.577,0.423,0.0,pp61
And do you consider yourself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Can you give me an example when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp61
Umm  last semester I was a squad leader in ROTC… umm’hua … which is where you lead about “coughs” six to eight people  umm  and you all have to work as a unit to earn  ahh  honor squad at the end of semester.,0.4939,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp61
umm’hua Which is dependent on upon  umm  our PT scores which we have competitive… PT being Physical Training  umm… umm’hua …we have different physical competitions each week.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
We also have  Naval Knowledge quizzes  etcetera  in working together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Umm  and we had  sometimes  the freshman are a little  umm  getting use to it a little slower  in to getting to the… umm’hua …swing of things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Umm  and  we have this one who is having issues with PT  so I helped have extra sessions  to help  umm  do more physical fitness and… umm’hua …ended up doing a lot better towards the end.,0.7893,0.195,0.805,0.0,pp61
O that’s great.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,pp61
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
My command presence.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
Meaning  umm  sometimes I’m more quite  and its something I think it over and not be as shy about when I talk to others and to feel confident when I know something.,0.6046,0.141,0.859,0.0,pp61
Umm  in order to fix this I often put myself out there and try and “coughs” not hide in the corner.,0.1326,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp61
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp61
And… why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp61
“laughs” umm  I’ve wanted to be a naval fighter pilot for a very  very long time and I have been taking steps to go beyond  umm.,0.1531,0.06,0.94,0.0,pp61
I’m going to be taking ground school next semester  and aerospace engineering  umm  and I’ve gone flying a few times  and I think that through ROTC and my own experiences I will be a good candidate for a fighter pilot in the Navy.,0.5423,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp61
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
I'm good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp62
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Okay so I was born in Irvine  California  um where I lived for about ten years.,0.2263,0.112,0.888,0.0,pp62
And um my parents and I actually moved back to Taiwan um at that point.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
So I went to an international school there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
It was mostly English speaking  but outside of school I would often speak Mandarin also with a couple of friends  um  as well as  you know  just getting by in the outside world.,0.7783,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp62
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Yeah  and so  yeah  so when I was after high school  I decided to apply to colleges in the U.S.,0.5709,0.207,0.793,0.0,pp62
Um just because I was more interested in living here and working here in the future.,0.4576,0.166,0.834,0.0,pp62
Mmmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
So  yep  applied to a couple of different schools.,0.3597,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Choosing  ending up choosing MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp62
Do you think you are a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um I would say that in terms of leadership style I would not consider myself a like a born leader.,0.3612,0.116,0.884,0.0,pp62
Um that said  I do think that I am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um I tend to be very you know I am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture.,0.4927,0.113,0.887,0.0,pp62
I think using that while I don't necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that.,0.3612,0.072,0.928,0.0,pp62
In that respect  I feel like I can I can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner.,0.7902,0.235,0.765,0.0,pp62
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp62
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Can you give me a example of a time where there was a conflict in your team and you had to solve it?,-0.128,0.072,0.837,0.092,pp62
Absolutely  yeah  I definitely do consider myself a team player.,0.6659,0.406,0.594,0.0,pp62
And um an example I can tell you about is I actually work as an EMT um so an Emergency Medical Technician here on campus.,-0.4364,0.0,0.893,0.107,pp62
And we have different um ranks within our crew so currently I am a second rider which means that there's there's usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew.,0.2732,0.057,0.943,0.0,pp62
And so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains.,-0.4215,0.0,0.833,0.167,pp62
And so we didn't know anything about this patient until we got there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
But when we did  um mostly the crew chief  the person above me  and I were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem.,-0.5499,0.0,0.876,0.124,pp62
And you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem.,-0.6478,0.0,0.831,0.169,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
But I think  whereas um I didn't necessarily think it was that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
And so you know we took a couple of minutes just to stand back and kind of you know   consider all of the possibilities.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
And um we ended up having to ask the patient like a couple of other questions.,0.3612,0.143,0.857,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
And what we ultimately found out was that he had a history of anxiety.,-0.1779,0.0,0.884,0.116,pp62
Oh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp62
So that um I think was was the was the root cause of the problem.,-0.4019,0.0,0.838,0.162,pp62
And um I think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line.,0.6478,0.159,0.841,0.0,pp62
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp62
If you had the option to change on thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
If I had the option to change one thing about myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
I think that I would definitely choose to make myself more confident.,0.7346,0.382,0.618,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Mostly as a speaker  I tend to be I tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when I have to speak in front of large groups of people.,0.5106,0.161,0.776,0.063,pp62
Um and I have worked on that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Both as an EMT  you know  you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more.,0.765,0.216,0.784,0.0,pp62
Um and also as leaders of different groups on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um such as I'm leader of MIT Met Life as well as the Association of Taiwanese Students.,0.2732,0.116,0.884,0.0,pp62
So you know in the various uh clubs and groups that I am involved in across campus  I've definitely had to I've definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people.,0.9001,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp62
Yeah and I think that ultimately that would help a great deal as for me as a doctor in the future.,0.8402,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp62
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp62
And why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp62
There are a couple of reasons I think I should get into medical school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Number one  I have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research.,0.7579,0.349,0.651,0.0,pp62
I work in a hematology lab here on campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
I've been working here for about a year already.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um and yeah I really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out.. Right.,0.8973,0.259,0.741,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Whether or not something works.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
And um so I mentioned before also that I work as an EMT so I so beyond having the scientific background  I also have a little bit of clinical background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Mmhmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
You know being able to manage patients and to talk to them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp62
And I think that's that's you know  a crucial component of being a doctor as well.,0.2732,0.123,0.877,0.0,pp62
But lastly I have a great deal of passion for the medical field.,0.8922,0.467,0.533,0.0,pp62
And um I hope that what I what I ultimately learn in medical school will give me I think the you know the opportunity to make a great difference in the medical field.,0.8689,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp62
Pretty good  how was yours?,0.7269,0.67,0.33,0.0,pp63
Ok!,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
It's nice to walk in from the <unintelligible>.,0.4215,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp63
Yeah it's  uh  it's been rather pleasant.,0.6705,0.524,0.476,0.0,pp63
I thought it was gonna snow today.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Yeah  same here!,0.3595,0.555,0.445,0.0,pp63
So  uh  why don't you tell me a little bit about your background?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Sure!,0.3802,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp63
Uh  so I am an MIT Junior.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Originally  I was  uh  a freshman at Michigan  and then I transferred to  uh  MIT for my sophomore year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Oh  great!,0.6588,0.815,0.185,0.0,pp63
Um  thank you  I'm studying  uh  Computer Science and  uh  I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year  um  or last summer  er  the summer before my sophomore year  and then  um  ever since I've more or less committed to it wholly and every minute to.,0.553,0.087,0.913,0.0,pp63
Huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Well good!,0.6476,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp63
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Tell me why!,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Um  I think  in some respects I can be a leader  but I wouldn't say like  in everything I do I'm a leader  so  um  in certain activities that I take part in  I definitely step up to a leadership position in certain situations  but I don't tend to try to be a leader all the time-- Hm.,0.8037,0.164,0.796,0.04,pp63
--because I do like to listen to feedback and I like more of a group contribution as opposed to  like  a single person leading all tasks  but  like  I remember doing a team exercise once where  uh  like lowering a Hula Hoop down with everyone's hands  um.,0.8047,0.213,0.742,0.045,pp63
when you have a group of people in a circle  and we realized that you needed to have someone sort of spearhead the  the operation there otherwise  like  everyone's trying to do their own thing  and so there are  it's mainly in those situations that I'll try to step up  but most of the time I  I don't like to be too controlling.,-0.2299,0.027,0.933,0.041,pp63
That makes sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Sometimes you lead  sometimes you follow.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Oh  definitely!,0.4574,0.749,0.251,0.0,pp63
Um Could you give me an example of a time you were on a team and you faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.064,0.936,0.0,pp63
Sure  um And you solved it So  uh  I guess that was one example of a challenge  uh  that we handle as a team  but um  let's see...Ok  so um  last year I was pledging at my fraternity  and we  one of the activities we do as a pledge  or as pledges  is  um  organize the formal for in the Fall  so uh  we're just given a budget and general guidelines for what a formal should consist of  and then we  we're tasked with setting up everything.,0.3291,0.049,0.951,0.0,pp63
So  um  in this situation  like all the 21 pledges uh  we got together and we allocated tasks and  um  obviously when you have a large event like this with so many people where they get together to bring in  to make it happen  you need to  sort of  uh  there are certain people who won't do their jobs  and so  um  part of what we did was  just  have this sort of setup of accountability where  you know  more or less one pledge would check on another group of pledges to make sure that they were getting their task done  and if they needed to help them out  and so  and this way we try to have somewhat decentralized leadership  but still  um  manage to pull off  yeah.,0.81,0.084,0.916,0.0,pp63
Ah  that's good to hear.,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp63
So  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Um  let's see  if I could change one thing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Mhm!,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
I would probably make myself slightly less of a procrastinator.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
I  um  I have a tendency to  like when I have a lot of free time  uh  to  to work on something  I don't get started  I don't make as much headway initially as I probably could or should.,0.7003,0.136,0.864,0.0,pp63
Um  and tend  um  in that respect  leave it  it's more like  my work is more weighted towards the latter half of the deadline  and so  um  I think just in terms of meeting my own goals like  uh  organizations that I get involved with  projects  it  it would just be more productive to  to be working  uh  full speed the entire time.,0.8016,0.122,0.86,0.017,pp63
So think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp63
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp63
So why do you think you should have the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Um  ok so  a job that I'd like to have is  uh  software engineering role  at  uh  a tech company or something.,0.5719,0.19,0.81,0.0,pp63
Uh  and um  I think I am a good fit for the job because I have a pretty strong background in computer programming skill sets for this position  um  I've been taking various computer science classes at MIT and engineering classes and learning  uh  the proper was.,0.8979,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp63
Uh not THE proper ways  but  um  good problem solving skills and ways to approach and ways to approach  um  hard problems and  um  that's  I think those are skills that are not difficult  not overly difficult to acquire  but most  many people do not acquire them in  uh  the engineering education.,0.5544,0.186,0.682,0.132,pp63
Well thank you!,0.5983,0.83,0.17,0.0,pp63
This concludes the interview.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp63
Oh  good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp63
So  um  please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp64
Um  So  my name is Andre  uh  I come from Finland  I've studied for two years at Cambridge University in England  umm where I did all sorts of engineering for the first two years but I chose to specialize in electrical engineering and information technologies.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Um  Currently I'm on an exchange year abroad to MIT doing Course 6.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
And at MIT I'm specializing in artificial intelligence -- machine learning  (score vector?),0.4767,0.205,0.795,0.0,pp64
machines -- and also device physics and some digital electronics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Um  Specifically in the area of device physics and digital electronics I'm looking at risk processors as well as  um  nanot- um  micro- and nanoscale  uh  semiconductor devices such as transistors  uhh specifically ballistic transistors  which operate at the smallest possible unit.,0.0,0.048,0.905,0.048,pp64
Em  so yeah.,0.3597,0.555,0.445,0.0,pp64
Uhh In the area of AI  I have undertaken  uh  certain competitions  uh  which I have been  uh  lucky to win.,0.8271,0.326,0.674,0.0,pp64
Um  in the first one I had to write a simulator where um  I wrote an AI to control a spacecraft which is -- Hmm -- supposed to be able to land and take off from Mars.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
And during that  I had to take into account planetary rotation  gravity  atmospheric effects  uh  aerobraking and all those things  so it was a pretty complex AI  to be able to handle all of that.,0.4939,0.086,0.914,0.0,pp64
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Also I undertook a competition  uh  at Cambridge.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Uhh in a team of six  we had to build an autonomous robot which was able to navigate a grid and pick up an object and put it in a  in the appropriate box.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
And there I um was a  a team lead where I managed the team until it did the tasks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
And also I wrote the AI for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Oh  great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp64
So uh  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Um  I think I have pretty good leadership qualities  umm mainly because I'm able to think uhh on a lo- longer scale  like what has to get accomplished uhh and be able to delegate tasks to people to achieve intermediate goal which will be kind of modular to the achievement of the uhhh long term goal.,0.8885,0.181,0.819,0.0,pp64
So for example  in the the  um  robotics project  we had- our  our ultimate goal was to build a chassis  build an electronics  build an AI  and have the robot win this competition.,0.5859,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp64
But uhhh we- we didn't go from like scrap metal to that in one go.,-0.395,0.0,0.84,0.16,pp64
We had to uh  we had to look at um  specifically first I had to write an AI which was uh  straight - the bit of a AI which was able to follow white lines on a black surface  um  and turn on the- uh  at the junctions of those lines.,0.2263,0.037,0.963,0.0,pp64
Um  The electronics guys to that end had to  uh  make some circuits which uhh connect the  um  infrared light form sensors to the kind of main CPU  the arm-core CPU.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Umm  So there was some circuit elements involved.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
And the  uh  mechanics guys had to pretty much just make a test chassis for us  um  but all that took some organizing because they were busy in the workshops  so they didn't have much time to screw arou -- to  uh  play around with  um  .,0.5574,0.102,0.866,0.031,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
you know  other  uh  other things  and the electronics guys had to  um  also schedule the time correctly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Ah  yes.,0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0,pp64
So uh  do you think you're a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Can you tell me about a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp64
How did you go about resolving it?,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp64
Um  So one of the challenges in the robotics competition  and this specific team  was that  um  we often had to share resources which were limited among other teams and also among the people in the team.,0.1531,0.089,0.863,0.048,pp64
Mm-hmm Um  For -- One of the resources  if I may say so  which had to be shared in  in our team was myself  because I ha-- (snickers) uhh  I was a bit of the project lead so I had to give some advice  and also  umm  sort out some technical points with both the electronics and the mechanics teams  and also I had to write my own AI  so I had to kind of balance between the  uh  two and kind of manage my time.,0.34,0.027,0.973,0.0,pp64
So  what I would try to do was  I would tell them  uh  that we would work out some sort of specific issue  of like sensor connections with the electrical  uh  team  and I would say  Okay guys  so you're going to build this now  and  How long is this going to take?,0.5267,0.079,0.921,0.0,pp64
and they would say  I don't know  it's going to take us  uh  a couple hours.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
And then I would have the time to  maybe for half an hour  go down to the workshop where the mechanical team are playing around  and I would talk to them and see  you know  what they're doing and how- how far apart they want the wheels  or something  uh  for the  you know for the touring to be efficient  or  where do you want the balance  because uh  we faced an  an issue: if we put too much  um  weight on the back of the robot  the robot might tip over.,0.6369,0.076,0.924,0.0,pp64
So we try  uhhh we have to  you know  uh  fix that issue.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
But  uh  once I had the two teams working  uh  I was able to go back and quickly  um  write some code.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
So the issue was that I needed to kind of give advice from time to time.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Umm  and I think I did that by delegating tasks pretty well.,0.6486,0.346,0.654,0.0,pp64
Oh  good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp64
So uh  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what do you think that would be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Um  I think I would try to become more succinct in how I speak and more engaging to people because often I find that umm I come off sometimes a bit geeky or dorky  and some people might not take to that a-- as easily.,0.3384,0.102,0.823,0.074,pp64
And -- Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
-- as a team lead  you have to be both inspiring and charismatic.,0.4215,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp64
Um  I mean  some uhhh  some great examples  I mean  I guess as a cliche  it's kind of like Steve Jobs  where he's  uh  amazingly inspiring  he's very good at talking to people  but he's also  um  like I wouldn't be able to say that he's kind of more (adducent?),0.8607,0.204,0.796,0.0,pp64
to .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
While at the same time  he is quite  you know  quite the geek being  you know  uh  in charge of Apple  and  you know  thinking about how to play with all these (unintelligible) Mmmh.,0.0828,0.066,0.877,0.057,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
toys.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
So  striking a balance like that  where you  kind of  you're kind of able to have the fun with the tech  and also be  uh  kind of serious   Hmm.,0.6378,0.174,0.779,0.048,pp64
um  but not boring-serious  um  so I try to strive towards that direction  uh  if I could.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Interesting.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp64
Em  so  and now  think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.172,0.828,0.0,pp64
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Um  I think that being a project lead in a robotics design team or a  like  an electronic product design team  uhh  would be really great fun  especially if I was also able to participate in the technical side and not only the managerial side.,0.8878,0.2,0.8,0.0,pp64
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Umm because being on the managerial side would allow me to  uh  kind of be able to set the  the direction  uh  in some way  which I enjoy doing  and also  manage the kind of  uh  the sub-teams  and how things will get done.,0.6249,0.108,0.892,0.0,pp64
But at the same time  being on the technical side  it's just fun to play around with all this really cool tech  and build it  especially  it's quite rewarding.,0.9543,0.396,0.604,0.0,pp64
Um  so I think I have the technical background for the technical part.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Um  I've  I've done my programming  I've done my AI - AI courses  my electronics courses  so I  so I know that pretty well.,0.6486,0.194,0.806,0.0,pp64
And I have the experience  um  of working in a team and being a team lead  uhh  to know how to manage a small but efficient team.,0.5719,0.125,0.875,0.0,pp64
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp64
Ah  well thank you for coming here today.,0.5574,0.434,0.566,0.0,pp64
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp64
tell me about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um so I'm obviously not from the States as the accent gives away.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
I'm from a smallish town called Carifargus near Belfast in Northern Ireland.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
I just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to Cambridge which was something I hadn't really thought was something appropiate for me.,0.6124,0.139,0.861,0.0,pp65
I kind of just envisaged going to one of the Northern Irish universities maybe one of the Scottish ones.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um so I applied to Cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that I was suitable.,0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp65
So I've spent the last two years um there studying engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
And then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the States.,0.4215,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp65
So I went for that immediately.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um I've been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering  Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Inerviewee: Uh just because I've always been interested in space and um it would be quite uh like a personal ambition to be somehow involved in future space exploration um in terms of actually like desigining the stuff and helping to actually deliver it.,0.8773,0.236,0.764,0.0,pp65
Um so ideally that's where I see my kind of professional career path going.,0.4754,0.192,0.808,0.0,pp65
Uh aside from that stuff I'm quite into sport.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Like I have three younger brothers so we'd often play sports together.,0.6326,0.341,0.659,0.0,pp65
Particularly rugby cricket um soccer.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Uh but I have got into the American ones since being here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um basketball um it's probably the one that was least aware of before I got here but I've managed to get tickets for a Celtics Timberwolves game tomorrow.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
[laughter] That should be good fun.,0.8555,0.758,0.242,0.0,pp65
And was as Fenway Park I think in my second week here or something.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Oh... A Red Sox game so... Immersing myself in the American culture.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Definitely enjoying my time here.,0.7269,0.67,0.33,0.0,pp65
Well good.,0.6124,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp65
Glad to hear you're uh getting to enjoy the city.,0.7351,0.437,0.563,0.0,pp65
So uh do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Can you tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um yes I think that I have the self-confidence to be a leader.,0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,pp65
I'm someone who's happy enough to stand in front of others and put their kind of head on the block as the saying is make a decision and accept that if it does go terrible the consequences will come back and I can't just pass the blame on.,-0.2732,0.109,0.745,0.146,pp65
Uh I think this is self-evident in positions I've held so far in my univeristy time in the UK where I was on the student council for my college Robinson College in Cambridge for both my freshmen and sophomore years.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um two different positions but both of them elected and competative elections.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Obviously my peers think that I'm uh suitable leadership material.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Mm-hm Um how does that allude to you from previous response sports is another big part of my life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
And in that I've had um competency rules with school's rugby and then college rugby and also college ruin.,-0.5859,0.0,0.826,0.174,pp65
Um so I feel I have the experience of leader of having been a leader before and I have the confidence to lead others while also realizing at the same time that there will be others in the group that have strengths that I don't have.,0.7184,0.12,0.88,0.0,pp65
So um I'm humble enough to realize that and and hopefully get the best out of others by not insisting that the way that I've initially thought to approach the problem is the only solution.,0.7579,0.214,0.723,0.063,pp65
You can be a leader a very good leader by listening to suggestions that others have and being able to discern which are implementable and which are merely to put on the let's leave that for now pile.,0.4576,0.079,0.891,0.03,pp65
So yeah I would feel that I'm a good leader.,0.659,0.403,0.597,0.0,pp65
Well good.,0.6124,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp65
So um do you consider yourself to be a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Can you give me an example of a time when you worked in a team and encountered some sort of a challenge?,0.0018,0.046,0.954,0.0,pp65
How did you go about resolving it?,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp65
Yeah so the obvious examples here would be sporting achievements and stuff but I think and just out of a variety a good antitote for growth um in the UK we still have a monarchy one of the few countries that do.,0.8338,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp65
Mm-hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
And the queen's husband rather than being king is the Duke of Edinburgh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
I'm not sure why he doesn't get to be a king but anyway so there's a scheme called Duke of Edinburgh's Award which is aimed at 16 17 18 year olds.,0.645,0.135,0.823,0.042,pp65
And there are three tiers too bronze silver and gold.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
So I've completed all of them.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
I have the set of the gold.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
And in order to do this a big part of it that people that undertake this scheme that they raise is the expedition element.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
Um you go somewhere you haven't been before with coordinates certainly maps compass tents troungier and enough food and supplies for like four days.,0.5994,0.182,0.818,0.0,pp65
Um you follow a predetermined route but obviously you have to uh like deal with unexpected realities.,0.5023,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp65
If there's flooding and suddenly a path is no longer a viable transport option you got to reroute yourself around that.,-0.296,0.0,0.901,0.099,pp65
If I come too exposed and there are high winds you need to decide for a different sleeping point for that night.,-0.0772,0.0,0.942,0.058,pp65
We did our gold expedition in the summers in the final years of my high school.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
We traveled to which is a very nice area naturally.,0.4754,0.256,0.744,0.0,pp65
We spent three days four night hiking really glorious weather.,0.6697,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp65
One big mission.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
When we encountered another group they were lost.,-0.3182,0.0,0.753,0.247,pp65
quite hysterical.,-0.101,0.0,0.418,0.582,pp65
They thought they will never be found.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
We made a decision we would make a detour from our way to get these other hikers in the nearest area so that they can then contact the other hikers they knew in that area.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
and pretty much get themselves back in to familiar surroundings calm them down make sure they are okay and go on to our planned destination.,0.8271,0.316,0.684,0.0,pp65
To be honest I did quite enjoyed that experience.,0.7841,0.496,0.504,0.0,pp65
getting to feel slightly like a hero.,0.675,0.526,0.474,0.0,pp65
That was a time when we had to work as a team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
One of us could not have dealt with all by themselves because they were five hysterical people with all their backpacks and equipments.,-0.0258,0.0,0.952,0.048,pp65
They were tired.,-0.4404,0.0,0.408,0.592,pp65
They weren’t feeling like carrying any more we had to distribute their load among ourselves and make sure we do not lose them on our way from where we found them to where we ultimately drop them off in the nearest village.,0.666,0.18,0.776,0.044,pp65
The whole expedition is a big example of team work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
keeping each other motivated keep going at the pace of the slowest individual so that no one is left behind .,0.1335,0.123,0.776,0.101,pp65
encouraging each other so that the slowest individual is not on the ground .,0.5267,0.207,0.793,0.0,pp65
It was massively enjoyable experience.,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp65
That would have been one major team work experience not to mention.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
If I give you an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
I think umm the one thing that really seems to set me aside between me and a lot of friends and my brothers that I could probably benefit from caring a little more about my outward appearance.,0.8519,0.215,0.785,0.0,pp65
Not that I think I dress very scruffly or anything but I don’t really mind leaving the house in the morning with my hair soaking shower and wearing jeans and t-shirt.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
two out of three of my brothers worry about straighten hair which I wouldn’t agree at all.,-0.1027,0.123,0.735,0.142,pp65
but if I cared little more just making sure my hair is not messy when I leave the house that would probably be small benefit.,0.9247,0.392,0.571,0.037,pp65
given that even though there is a saying don’t judge by covers people inevitably make decisions as soon as they see you.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
and they can’t perhaps if I was a bit more self conscious about my appearance that would be something of a benefit Think of a job you would like to have.,0.6705,0.159,0.841,0.0,pp65
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
I think this is the kind of job in which job satisfaction can be the greatest benefit if it is something that is genuinely interesting to you.,0.9153,0.358,0.642,0.0,pp65
And as I said before I have such a deep rooted interest in space exploration just really pushing the limits of what we can achieve.,0.5994,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp65
I feel that this kind of job is what I will just get up in the mornings really thrilled get into work and do my parts towards contributing towards it.,0.4927,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp65
umm I realize it’s also the kind of job where projects are really so vast ranging there is gonna be inevitable variety and also this would scare me I would be really drawn I get to challenge myself in various different ways novel situations that I perhaps haven’t encountered before with the opportunity to work with other professionals who are equally umm well established within the field that you are really getting to work with the best and that can only help improve me as a professional and as a business person.,0.9201,0.173,0.796,0.03,pp65
and it’s um yeah other things such as inevitable prestige and umm the financial benefit just the job satisfaction .,0.7964,0.323,0.677,0.0,pp65
I can easily see this something that will interest keep me coming back for work for the length of my career.,0.6597,0.221,0.779,0.0,pp65
That would be the key reason.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
um I think I would just be able to enjoy the work and therefore put my best and get the best out of my and ultimately give the company the best chance to success.,0.9702,0.434,0.566,0.0,pp65
Thank you for interviewing with us today.,0.3612,0.294,0.706,0.0,pp65
thanks for letting me come out.,0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0,pp65
umm It turned out okay.,0.2263,0.322,0.678,0.0,pp65
I think it was a group of case female.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
17 to 18 years age range.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
we opened nearby village public and get to a public phone.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
our school was quite strict.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp65
didn’t allow us to bring mobile phone.,0.2263,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp65
which was probably a good thing.,0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0,pp65
Can you tell me a little bit about your background?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
I'm a student here at MIT  I'm in my third year as a junior  um  and I'm studying chemical biological engineering with a minor in economics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
And so  as part of that I've uh taken coursework in transport processes  thermodynamics  chemical biological processes  and things like that.,0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,pp66
And also some macro  micro  public policy classes with the econ.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
And then I'm also doing research in chemical engineering laboratory here for a year and a half studying yeast  um  and different ways of doing transcription factors and how they relate then to promoter architecture and the dynamics that are behind that.,0.2732,0.049,0.951,0.0,pp66
So  lot of bio chemical engineering complications.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
And I also did some research this past summer in a systems biology lab in Madrid  Spain  um  so a little more biology related  so  those are most of my technical background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Excellent.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp66
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Yeah  so um  I definitely think I'm a leader and that's actually something that's come to define a lot of my time here at MIT is leadership.,0.6326,0.171,0.829,0.0,pp66
Um  and so I think I'm a leader both because of the actions I've taken and also the mindset I have and as actions  I guess both of those things are important.,0.2023,0.055,0.945,0.0,pp66
So to give an example  um  I'm currently in a position of leadership in a club on campus  our Habitat for Humanity club  um  where I serve as the president of the club and I think I started off as a freshman  um  just participating  I really like community service so I volunteered with them a bit to go help build houses in the Boston/Cambridge area  um  and then I was fairly proactive which led me to start organizing those builds that I was going on  I figured I was benefiting from them  so I wanted to be able to give back and organize them so I ran for the exec of Habitat for Humanity here and started helping organize them  and then from there I went on to wanting to do more  and so now I'm president and run the exec and get to do everything that the club does  and so  um  I think that kind of drive and that desire to move up and give back and contribute and also make things happen definitely is characteristic of a leader.,0.9312,0.083,0.917,0.0,pp66
Um  and obviously  the position I'm currently in is one that demands leadership.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
So I think that's just one illustrative example of why I'm a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Yes very good.,0.7089,0.855,0.145,0.0,pp66
So uh  are you a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,pp66
How did you go about solving it?,0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp66
Yeah  um  so I definitely think I'm a team player  um  and I think MIT especially is really conducive to teamwork.,0.6344,0.214,0.786,0.0,pp66
Um  but I'll look at a example of team work than relates actually to  um  I'm also involved in leadership within my fraternity.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
And so  as a part of that  um  we have a five person exec that uh I wasn't on to begin with  but uh  I've now loosened up and wanted to take on more leadership  help out  and so I'm currently on.,0.6082,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp66
And so  as a part of that five person exec  um  we've had to do a lot of teamwork.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
There's five of us  there's uh  my fraternity has seventy people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Um  so it's very large and it requires a lot of working together in order to  um  accomplish really any task.,0.4215,0.123,0.877,0.0,pp66
And so I think  um  one illustrative example is we wanted to put on a philanthropy event that I was spearheading in my position.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
I was doing brotherhood development activities  like a philanthropy even.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp66
And so  we haven't really had much precedent  we haven't had an event in a couple of years  um  and so I had come up with a summer with an event based off some stuff for other friends and other schools who I've talked to.,0.4767,0.066,0.934,0.0,pp66
Um  and so I had the idea for the event and then I had to work with these other four members to kind of lead the rest of our brotherhood in putting on the event  organizing it  um  and there was a lot challenges because it wasn't  there was no precedent  we hadn't done things like this in the past  um  so we had to work to like motivate people within ourselves to go out and get people to register and participate and things like that.,0.7703,0.116,0.861,0.023,pp66
Um  and there's also of course the challenge of then finding others.,0.0772,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp66
Um  give us five dollars to participate in our event  why it's of any value  why it matters.,0.3612,0.179,0.821,0.0,pp66
And so that duality was really a challenge  as well as of course working amongst ourselves  and so we met those by really laying out very concrete goals  um  and like  doing a lot of brainstorming among the five of us  breaking up  um  to focus on different elements of the problems we would face.,0.3566,0.103,0.852,0.045,pp66
Um  and the event ended up being really tremendously successful and then we had a lot of people participate.,0.6566,0.195,0.805,0.0,pp66
We met those goals of participation and money raised um  and then were able to have the event again this year and really set a precedent that hadn't existed before  so  it was very successful.,0.624,0.107,0.893,0.0,pp66
That's very excellent.,0.6115,0.666,0.334,0.0,pp66
So uh  what's your greatest weakness?,0.34,0.382,0.364,0.255,pp66
If you had to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Um  so I think currently  um  what my greatest weakness  and one which I'm working on  is my ability  I talked a lot just now about leadership positions and so they definitely impact me a lot.,0.7703,0.214,0.723,0.063,pp66
Right now my ability to successfully delegate  um and the word  I'm not necessarily looking for the word micro-manage  but just truly delegate responsibility  work with another person  and let them be very responsible and communicate with them.,0.8747,0.244,0.756,0.0,pp66
I think i struggle there and that's definitely a weakness in my leadership as well as just my general activities because i struggle just to let that person kind of go and foster their own ideas and get their own job done.,-0.3818,0.098,0.752,0.15,pp66
I'm very quick to step in and assist maybe step on their toes even or at least provide feedback.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Sometimes it is warranted and sometimes I think it isn't  and so to be more cognizant of that and to uh be better adept to deal with that I think would be very helpful.,0.7178,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp66
And so  I'd love to see that change.,0.6682,0.39,0.61,0.0,pp66
It is something I'm working towards and I'm working with people whose leadership I admire  um  who I think do a better job of that then me and try and model myself after them  but currently I do think it's a weakness that I'd like to improve.,0.7506,0.195,0.739,0.065,pp66
So  think of a job you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp66
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp66
Got one?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
Yes.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp66
So now  why do you think you deserve this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp66
So  for this particular job  um  I think my greatest assets are the combination of skills and experiences that I bring to the table.,0.7096,0.211,0.789,0.0,pp66
Um and I think that it'd be very valuable for the position.,0.5256,0.236,0.764,0.0,pp66
So I have a very strong technical background  I'm in my third year at MIT studying chemical biological engineering which requires a wide array of very challenging coursework.,0.669,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp66
Um  and I've done research in the field as well  so all of those skills combine to give me a strong technical set of both problem solving and engineering based skills.,0.6249,0.208,0.72,0.072,pp66
And then I also have done a lot of work outside of the classroom  both in projects that are academic related and totally not  community services related and things of that nature  um truly develop communication skills  organization skills  um  and the ability to really take a project and get it done.,0.6369,0.094,0.906,0.0,pp66
And so I think for this position I will have the technical background to fully understand and wrap my mind around and make goals that I want to accomplish just solve a problem and then these other skills will ensure that not only can I identify a problem  but if I identify a problem I will get it done and I know how to facilitate whatever resources that are available to me to ensure that whatever job gets done well  so I think that will make me a very strong candidate.,0.8376,0.163,0.768,0.069,pp66
Well thank you  thanks for your time.,0.7579,0.652,0.348,0.0,pp66
Oh well  please tell me a little bit about your background.,0.5267,0.328,0.672,0.0,pp67
Alright.,0.25,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
um So  for starters  I am a senior taking an extra semester so you know  half-way through junior year in that sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
I'm a chemical engineer  I'm a rower  light weight rower  not a heavy weight.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
I have the extra  an extra bonus of having to deal with a weight cap  that sort of thing.,0.5423,0.163,0.837,0.0,pp67
Diving in the middle of the year can be fun sometimes.,0.5574,0.338,0.662,0.0,pp67
I'm in a fraternity  um it actually recently started up.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
So I was a founding father of the fraternity  it's Sigma Alpha Epselon.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
And I've also done very rougly coordinated engineering leadership program.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
So I'd say those are my main commitments.,0.128,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp67
I had done other things earlier one  I went to Baker and I was very involved in the executive committee there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
And I'm also an active member in creating the dining plan that currently exists at MIT.,0.5994,0.259,0.741,0.0,pp67
It's got some pros and cons  but it is a good experience so sort of like go door to door and talk to people and really see  let them know what's coming up.,0.7939,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp67
THat sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
In general I'd say I'm a pretty active person on campus  pretty well known  um and I do a lot of things to keep myself in shape but also academically stimulated with chemical engineering and whatnot.,0.7876,0.243,0.757,0.0,pp67
So you think you're a leader  tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
Very much so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
um I guess to start out  being part of the sport sort of creates a natural affinity towards teamwork.,0.5118,0.202,0.798,0.0,pp67
Especially with rowing you're depending on other people to be able to accomplish a common goal  there's eight guys in a boat and then there's the person that steers it.,0.4215,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp67
And if one person gives up you guys aren't going to win.,-0.4717,0.0,0.782,0.218,pp67
So that is very much like teamwork  it also coincides with leadership.,0.4173,0.202,0.798,0.0,pp67
Rowig doesn't necessarily cultivate leadership  it sort of cultivates like personal dedication and willingness to contribute to the whole.,0.5118,0.202,0.798,0.0,pp67
But I feel like I get my leadership experiences from my fraternity.,0.5023,0.228,0.772,0.0,pp67
Especially since it started out  I was one of eight people  there was five that was the founding five  that was part of the first pledge class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
And when things are starting up everyone needs to take a leadership role and if anyone like cuts any slack it's very likely that the whole ship is going to sink.,0.0772,0.074,0.861,0.065,pp67
So right from the get go I was given tons of responsibility and I went with it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
I did as much as I could in each of the positions and eventually I came up to the role of  you know  the President.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
um And in that role I've gotten a lot of praise from the alumni groups and from my students  but generally I feel like I'm a pretty good  I like to work with people  um I can relate to them  and generally pretty sociable  so yeah.,0.9823,0.427,0.573,0.0,pp67
Well  sounds like a (?),0.5574,0.605,0.395,0.0,pp67
situation.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
So do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
Can you tell me of a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge  how did you go about solving it?,0.4019,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp67
Alright  let me come up with a good example here.,0.5994,0.38,0.62,0.0,pp67
Alright  Gordon has a new leadership program very much about being a team player.,0.25,0.133,0.867,0.0,pp67
There's different opportunities that that program provides  every single week it's divided up so that each student gets an opportunity to be a leader or be a part of the team.,0.6597,0.157,0.843,0.0,pp67
One of the modules for instance  there was  it was a negotiation module.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
So every single table was given a set of legos.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
And there was the goal of the project was to create satellites which requires a certain number of colored legos from each table  and every table was given different combinations.,0.5423,0.169,0.831,0.0,pp67
So I was not the team leader in that case  but the team leader's goal was to make sure that we had good negotiations going with all of the tables adjacent to us  and coordinating everything.,0.7783,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp67
And at times it got a little bit frustrating because there were time limits  and people were running all over the place.,-0.3862,0.0,0.889,0.111,pp67
And one of my roles was to be one of the negotiators  so as the team player my role was to simply talk to one table  get as best of a result as possible to get the parts that we need to make the satellite but not to be directing people and nothing of the sort.,0.3818,0.045,0.955,0.0,pp67
um My natural instinct is to direct people so what I had to do instead to make sure that I was used effectively as a team leader  you know  just give the team leader suggestions  that sort of things  but also do my duty  negotiate  we consulted for a while.,0.5187,0.102,0.898,0.0,pp67
Said  OK Cameron  we need to get three white legos for four brown legos etc etc.,0.4466,0.164,0.836,0.0,pp67
So I managed to get my end of the deal done um also contribute to the team leader but also give him advice  and that sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
It's kind of a lower key example  just because those modules  the time schedule is an hour.,-0.296,0.0,0.879,0.121,pp67
But they put you in a high pressure situation  but I felt like I did a good job there because I didn't go all up in arms and tell the team leader that he was not doing a good job  that sort of thing.,0.2939,0.134,0.755,0.111,pp67
So I did my best to give him the suggestions to steer him in the right direction and ultimately it got us to the end goal.,0.6369,0.144,0.856,0.0,pp67
That makes sense  thanks for sharing that.,0.6908,0.533,0.467,0.0,pp67
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
So  if you had the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
I go back and forth with this.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
When I was younger in middle school  uh I was a lot more modest  I was just generally a quieter person.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
You know  everyone goes through different phases  through elementary  middle  high school  college  that sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
um And ultimately I turned into someone taht was a lot more sociable  outgoing  that sort of thing.,0.688,0.262,0.738,0.0,pp67
But at times I feel that I can come off as  I hate saying this but I  other people don't say it but sometimes I feel like I may say something and it might be cocky or something of the sort.,-0.5499,0.068,0.791,0.142,pp67
So one thing I'm really trying to balance is to make sure that I have confidence but it's not overbearing.,0.4215,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp67
So I guess  what I'd wanna do right now  like if I could change something  is really try and bring back the modesty because I really respect people that are modest but still able to get a lot of work done.,0.4491,0.092,0.908,0.0,pp67
um And  I mean  it's not something that I can't change  it's just something that's really not jibing with my personality right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
So  I'm really  you know  trying to tow the line.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
But if I could make that switch  I'd at least like to see what kind of a person I'd like to be right now.,0.7579,0.228,0.772,0.0,pp67
I guess  I guess I'll leave that answer for now.,-0.0516,0.0,0.882,0.118,pp67
Interesting.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
Thank you for sharing.,0.6486,0.726,0.274,0.0,pp67
And now  think of a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.2,0.8,0.0,pp67
Anyone in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
So now  why do you think you should have this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
Well  the job is  it's a pretty  lots of people look are sort of looking at it at MIT but it's consulting.,0.3919,0.154,0.846,0.0,pp67
You work with people  you work with teams  and every single team has a project with a defined deadline  scope  budget  that sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
Which is the stuff I've learned from the Gordon Leadership Engineering Program.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
Um  so that you know  exactly that  working in a team  trying to accomplish a goal in a certain time  blah  blah  blah.,0.4019,0.181,0.664,0.155,pp67
I'm a very big fan of that  ever since I joined the program I'm like wow  this is business  I like business.,0.8854,0.387,0.613,0.0,pp67
And the reason why I prefer consulting right now rather than going into energy or going into connectors?,0.2732,0.11,0.89,0.0,pp67
that sort of thing  is just because of the breadth.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp67
I like  I'm a person that likes to keep my doors open  and consulting is one of those really good segways in my opinion from undergraduate into the industry.,0.8173,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp67
I'm not particularly interested in grad school at the moment just because there's no one thing that like  I wanna like  I don't wanna narrow my scope quite yet.,0.0837,0.144,0.721,0.135,pp67
So I feel like consulting will give me an environment where there's still a young vibe with a lot of newer people and also expose me to older people and really  uh  I'll be able to test my skills that I've cultivated while I've been here in the job industry.,0.2878,0.053,0.917,0.031,pp67
Interesting.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp67
So  uhh  please tell me about your background.,0.3774,0.269,0.731,0.0,pp69
Uhh  so I'm uhh  I was born in D.C.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
moved to Nigeria when I was seven  umm  came back to America for my junior and senior year of highschool and applied to MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
I always wanted to be a mechanical engineer  so it was sort of a straightforward choice for me.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
It was always my first choice school  and umm  I was excited to come here and to start learning things.,0.34,0.112,0.888,0.0,pp69
It just  in the past  it had just been sort of hearing about things but not doing anything or learning about it  which was exciting.,0.6486,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp69
So I'm studying mechanical engineering here now  and umm  I'm concentrating in computer science and electro engineering  which has been a new found interest  I guess.,0.4588,0.107,0.893,0.0,pp69
It's uhh  I'm a junior now  so yeah.,0.4341,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp69
Well  cool.,0.5267,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp69
So  uhh  you think you're a leader  tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
I do think I'm a leader in some regards.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
I mean  it's important to not always  and sometimes you don't want to be a leader.,0.1476,0.106,0.822,0.072,pp69
Um  it's important to know how to follow as well  but I think  umm  I am  like  in most situations  a leader.,0.6369,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp69
For example  I was  uh  sort of like  the leader for my 212 Intro to Robotics group  where we build a robot  amongst the four of us  four to five.,0.2975,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp69
Uhh  my group happened to be four.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
We built a robot.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
I sort of lead the group:  organizing meetings  uhh  delegating tasks  making sure that everyone was doing  uhh  what they were meant to  and just getting everyone on the same page.,0.3182,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp69
So just instances like that  I think  have shaped me into being a leader.,0.4144,0.175,0.825,0.0,pp69
Uh  very good.,0.4927,0.615,0.385,0.0,pp69
So uhh  do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
Can you give an example of a time you were working on a team  and faced some sort of challenge?,0.0018,0.05,0.95,0.0,pp69
How did you resolve it?,0.3818,0.394,0.606,0.0,pp69
Uhh  so yeah  like I said  it's also important to know how to  you know  let someone else take the lead.,0.7245,0.282,0.718,0.0,pp69
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
And so  my other project class this semester I'm taking  to double in (unintelligible)  and it's a group of eight people  so there's even more  sort of  heads to balance.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
And so  uhh  just sort of working with everyone  making sure that  you know  everyone sort of has a say in what's going on.,0.3182,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp69
There's a particular instance where it's at the beginning of the project  we're meant to design a yo-yo  and we couldn't really decide on a design  'cause everyone wanted to do their own sort of thing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
And  umm  my role in that particular situation was to  getting everyone to recognize the manufacturing aspect and not only the design aspect.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
So we ended up choosing something that was easy to manufacture as well as had a good design.,0.7845,0.345,0.655,0.0,pp69
Well  very good.,0.6478,0.841,0.159,0.0,pp69
So  uhh  if you could change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
Change one thing about myself...  Uhh  I'd say  like  to...I wish I had a sort of  better background of academics.,0.7787,0.315,0.685,0.0,pp69
Uhh  I didn't go to  like  the best high school.,0.4749,0.294,0.559,0.147,pp69
I didn't  uhh  like  have the best teachers or things like that.,0.6798,0.376,0.505,0.118,pp69
And coming to a place like this and sort of seeing a lot of people who are  I mean  obviously kind of naturally talented  but who have also had good- they've had opportunities to  uhh  show their talent and get better and smarter.,0.9709,0.387,0.613,0.0,pp69
Umm  I wish I could've had that opportunity.,0.6705,0.478,0.522,0.0,pp69
I think I'd be  uhh  even more-  I could do more things than I am doing today.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
So  yeah.,0.3597,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp69
And  uhh  now think about a job that you'd like to have.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp69
Mmm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
So  uhh  now why should we hire you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
Because  uhh  you should hire me for a few reasons.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
One  is because my leadership  uhh  abilities  which I've talked a little bit about  umm  a little earlier.,0.25,0.105,0.895,0.0,pp69
But  also  just my willingness to learn.,0.3919,0.306,0.694,0.0,pp69
Umm  I think  more than the average person  I'm excited to learn new things  umm  and sort of put those things in practice.,0.34,0.098,0.902,0.0,pp69
And  just as an example  I didn't know anything about computer science before coming to MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp69
But  just uhh  taking just the introductory class  learning about that  I got really interested in that  and so  I'd say that when I don't know a lot of things  or when my experience isn't the best  I'm always willing to learn a lot.,-0.1437,0.079,0.831,0.09,pp69
And lastly  I'm a really hard worker.,-0.1761,0.0,0.78,0.22,pp69
And so  I'm able to put in the hours and the time and the energy that it takes to  sort of  get a task done.,0.2732,0.08,0.92,0.0,pp69
It's uhh  yeah  I think I'd make a good intern.,0.6249,0.389,0.611,0.0,pp69
Well  thank you for interviewing with us today.,0.5574,0.434,0.566,0.0,pp69
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp69
Please tell me about your background.,0.3182,0.315,0.685,0.0,pp7
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
I'm a junior at MIT majoring in electrical engineering computer science as well as mathematics.,0.2732,0.13,0.87,0.0,pp7
Um and I have a couple of previous internships under my belt as you can see on my resume  so I feel like I come prepared with a lot of experience both from school and outside.,0.5667,0.121,0.879,0.0,pp7
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
Uh yes  I would say that I am a leader.,0.4019,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp7
Um in particular I've been involved in many student groups on campus such as educational studies program  mystery hunt and several other groups that I have leaderships positions in.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
But even when I don't have a formal leadership role as I do in those groups  I feel like I still tend to take charge in situations  whether it's a group project for the class where  you know we're supposed to be working collaboratively but I'll be sending emails to make sure we're moving forward and making progress.,0.872,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp7
Or something a bit more structured actually supposed to have a have a leader like I mentioned student groups.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,pp7
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
Can you give me an example where there was conflict in your team and how you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp7
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp7
So yes  heh  I would call myself a team player and to go back to sort of one of the examples I was just talking about with uh the educational studies program with a fairly large student group.,0.2766,0.073,0.881,0.046,pp7
We have a couple hundred different MIT students teach with us but a core team of about 30 to 40 admins who come to meetings every week and help out.,0.5499,0.109,0.891,0.0,pp7
And unfortunately being college students there's a lot of personal conflict between members and I have had to step in several times with sort of individual people first notice that there's a problem  um talk to the people in question individually to figure out more about what's going on and then intervene and sort of set aside rules and sort of help them interact well professionally and keep their problems outside the group.,-0.6801,0.055,0.821,0.124,pp7
Um I don't really want to get into details because some of these can be personal but I have had to do this.,-0.0566,0.0,0.947,0.053,pp7
If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
It's a difficult question.,-0.3612,0.0,0.545,0.455,pp7
I'd probably say my age.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
I feel like there are a lot of experiences I've missed out on  sort of looking backing at you know  high school  say now that I'm in college or looking back at a first internship once I've done a second.,0.0276,0.058,0.863,0.079,pp7
Um  there are a lot of ways I think I could've learned more or matured more as a person had I got into situations with a different mindset.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
So um I guess what I'm trying to say is if I knowing what I know now will able to go uh redo some of the things of the past year at least which isn't physically possible.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
Why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp7
Ok  well as I mentioned before I have a lot of experience  I leadership  I'm a team player but uh beyond that I think I'm just very well qualified and passionate about your company and would be excited to join the team and work with you guys to further your goals.,0.9407,0.271,0.729,0.0,pp7
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
I'm Good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp70
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp70
Tell me a little more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Uh so I am a biology major at the IT um  Burton of Biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
I'm also getting a minor in chemistry.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
I'm currently pursuing research on marine micro-biology   specifically Carlson bounds at the Thompson Lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Um  previously i had worked on arsenic metabolizing simbions in the sponge in Israel  and I hope to continue working on marine-microbes.,0.4404,0.121,0.879,0.0,pp70
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp70
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Umm  I would say I was a leader not so much  uhm   in maybe project teams but definitely in terms of uhm my research view.,0.5499,0.129,0.871,0.0,pp70
I would like to be on the cutting edge of uhm new research and to  uhm  microbes encyclobes vents part of the ocean  so i would say that i'm really looking forward to researching  but really haven't been exposed so much.,0.3024,0.081,0.889,0.029,pp70
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.1,0.811,0.089,pp70
Uhh yeah I would def consider myself a team  um  player.,0.296,0.18,0.82,0.0,pp70
Uh  so  when  I am part of the team HPV group now at IT so we raise awareness about the Hepititus B virus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
so we rec had a lot of difficulties with quest  uhm  industries  so they're the ones that provide us with phlebotomists and in order to conduct the screening  hepatitis B screenings that we have.,-0.296,0.0,0.937,0.062,pp70
so Uhm there is a pretty large conflict about like how we should reach out to them to get them to get them to interact with us and whether or not we should   uhm  maybe reach out to other providers and i definitely tried to make sure that we were keeping up with our contacts at quest as well as like researching like new avenues - reaching out to giliad  which is another industry  uhm   core that could  uhm   also  that works actually with MIT in particular.,0.9382,0.218,0.759,0.023,pp70
Um so together we delegated work  and so one person had to do this  um  reach out to them and one person had to do that and i was def a big part of taking in whatever  everything that we had to do and like trying to make sure everyone had something in order to not let this really important part of our work would be lost.,0.5709,0.111,0.858,0.032,pp70
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Uh  i would def say it would be  my self confidence issues.,0.5106,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp70
or rather  my ability to speak up and be more  uhm   assertive about my point of view.,0.3182,0.126,0.874,0.0,pp70
I've definitely  a lot of times  kept quiet or just like put my views on the back burner  especially I think when i was a fresh coming to a new country it was very difficult to integrate and also like to navigate my way in  so i think i'm still trying to cope with that.,0.7357,0.159,0.796,0.044,pp70
okay  why do you think you should get into graduate school?,0.2263,0.16,0.84,0.0,pp70
I def think i deserve to get into grad school because it's the only thing i want to do - research for me is extremely exciting  and there is a lot.,0.5849,0.142,0.858,0.0,pp70
i feel like its the most meaningful way that i can contribute to   uh  the scientific world.,0.624,0.253,0.747,0.0,pp70
and especially in my field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp70
Uuh i def am dedicated to research it's what i want to do for the rest of my life so i hope that i get this opportunity.,0.8667,0.318,0.682,0.0,pp70
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp71
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp71
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
So I'm studying mechanical engineering at MIT  and I am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering... Hmmm.,0.2263,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp71
...and I've chosen to concentrate on building technology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
And on top of that  um I'm double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration.,0.4404,0.206,0.794,0.0,pp71
And I'd say two years ago  two summers ago sorry  I interned at Square One Armoring Services  which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government.,-0.0772,0.0,0.954,0.046,pp71
And I interned with them for two summers  and this was before I really chose the building technology route.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
I didn't really like the super mechy side of it.,0.4285,0.287,0.552,0.161,pp71
This past summer I interned in Barcelona  um  with a company called Ilon(?),0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
they're a very large engineering consulting firm and I worked in their architecture department.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
And I really enjoyed the experience.,0.5563,0.418,0.582,0.0,pp71
So  I'm going that direction.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Ahh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
And tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
I believe I am a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Um  I normally  I wouldn't necessarily run for positions  but when it comes down to someone filling the spot  I will step up  um  and make sure that things get done.,0.4497,0.09,0.91,0.0,pp71
I feel that I might be more of a...of an encourager  so to speak...I don't really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but I try  sort of to like  to lead people in the direction that I want to go to and to integrate their input with mine.,0.5183,0.104,0.867,0.029,pp71
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
And  do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.1,0.811,0.089,pp71
Um  so I uh  had a coach here this past year to plan the campus preview weekend dinner  um at my sorority.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Its a weekend where MIT pre-freshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from MIT and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus.,0.4588,0.118,0.882,0.0,pp71
And um  so my coach and I had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it  but I feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event.,0.7564,0.123,0.835,0.042,pp71
Um  a lot of the girls that came to the dinner  um  who are now freshmen  still say  Oh I remember you from (unintelligible).,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
It was a really good feeling to get through that.,0.6087,0.383,0.617,0.0,pp71
Ah  good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp71
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Um  I'd probably change trying to be a perfectionist.,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp71
Um  I like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things.,0.8583,0.368,0.632,0.0,pp71
Um  I think thats something  to sort of  a strange thing to work on  to let things be sometimes  heh.,-0.4005,0.0,0.83,0.17,pp71
Ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
I think I'm qualified for this position academically  and I've taken a lot of courses that apply to building technology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp71
And my intern experience as well.,0.2732,0.296,0.704,0.0,pp71
I'm really interested in the subject matter  and my parents are architects  so I've sort of had this my whole life and I've always kind of denied my interest in architecture because everyone always pushed me towards it  but now I do realize that this is something I truly enjoy.,0.8779,0.223,0.742,0.035,pp71
And sort of mixing it in with my other more technical interests  um  I feel bring me further in the field.,0.3134,0.102,0.898,0.0,pp71
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Good  how are you?,0.4404,0.492,0.508,0.0,pp72
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp72
Tell me a little bit more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
OK  so I'm a third year linguistics student  umm  I'm  uhh  working on some linguistics research right now and I'm interested in going into linguistics research after undergrad.,0.6841,0.178,0.822,0.0,pp72
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Yea I think I'm uhh leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
I think I've fulfilled leadership positions in the past and umm I think I've excelled in that role umm.,0.7184,0.261,0.739,0.0,pp72
I've led different group projects in my classes and I've also been umm a resident associate advisor in my dorm umm  and I've led activities there where we had to organize events for freshmen once a month uhh to get them interested in different aspects of the curriculum and also umm just general helping them out for things  so.,0.5994,0.079,0.921,0.0,pp72
OK  and do you consider yourself a team player?,0.4466,0.268,0.732,0.0,pp72
Can you give me an example of a time where there was conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.104,0.803,0.092,pp72
OK  umm  so yea I think I work well as a team member  umm  for a big group project we had in one of my linguistics classes  umm  we had to look at aspects of a language and so we were broken into groups of four  umm  and we were each split to look into different aspect of the language so two people looked at the phonology  or the sounds of the system  and my partner and I looked at the grammar of the language  and so one of the two people assigned to the phonology group wasn't really following through with his part of the work  umm.,0.1703,0.044,0.926,0.03,pp72
He  I guess he was busy with other classes but his partner was really stressed out about it so she came and talked to my partner and I and asked what she should do about it  cause he wasn't helping out.,-0.707,0.0,0.869,0.131,pp72
And so  the three of us sort of talked about it  and then we emailed him asked if he could come meet with all of us.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
The four of us were able to talk about it and work out an agreement where he did some of the...some extra work in putting the two parts together  the phonology and the syntax  to make up for the fact that he hadn't done as much for the original research.,0.6705,0.103,0.897,0.0,pp72
So  that ended up working out well  so.,0.2732,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp72
OK  good.,0.7034,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp72
And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Um  I think it would...probably be my shyness because that tends to hold me back.,-0.3182,0.0,0.859,0.141,pp72
Um  but I think I've been working to change that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Um  I've been trying to practice things umm like presentations that make me nervous or that I have problems with because I'm shy.,-0.5106,0.088,0.671,0.24,pp72
I've also been trying to get out and meet more people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
I've been doing more extracurriculars.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
And  umm  I volunteered to teach a class to middle schoolers and high schoolers  so  that sort of helped in a low stress environment practising presenting.,-0.5994,0.0,0.83,0.17,pp72
And  why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp72
Um  I think I would be a really good addition to a linguistics research team  because I'm really really passionate about linguistics and it's something I really enjoy spending lots of time working on.,0.8924,0.256,0.744,0.0,pp72
Um  and I enjoy working on a team and I work well with other people.,0.6486,0.29,0.71,0.0,pp72
And I've had research positions in the past and I think I would umm be a good addition to a team.,0.4404,0.127,0.873,0.0,pp72
So how are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.42,0.58,0.0,pp73
Good!,0.4926,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp73
Tell me a little bit about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I'm a freshman at MIT here  so I'm studying courses 6 and 18 which is computer science and math.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
Umm in high school I did a lot of community work service.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I was the president of our United Way board which is a not for profit.,0.1012,0.154,0.714,0.132,pp73
I did a lot of our school clubs  math teams classic goal.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I was captain of a lot of those  and then on campus here part of my sorority Sigma Kappa  the tech.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
fair which is involved in bringing a lot of companies and students here to showcase their things.,0.3182,0.126,0.874,0.0,pp73
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I think so.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I think umm  I have a little different view of what a leader is.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I think there's definitely one aspect that's very obvious  that you know  you bring everyone to do what you think is best  but I think the most important part of being a leader is incorporate everyone else's ideas.,0.7261,0.168,0.832,0.0,pp73
I think a lot of times some people who are really strong are like natural leaders  but they don't always take the time to make sure everyone else likes what they're doing and they're very straight forward  and they go for it  but I think what makes a really important leader is being able to incorporate everyone else's ideas and find that middle ground that everyone wants to do.,0.9433,0.225,0.775,0.0,pp73
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp73
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.1,0.811,0.089,pp73
Definitely  umm I know in high school as a senior last year they gave us a lot of group projects to kind of bring us out of the stereotypical classroom and get ready for uh  a new environment in college and I remember one of our projects it was my group and we were doing something for our econ.,0.6369,0.084,0.916,0.0,pp73
class  and it was  we had to like model a situation and do the graphs  and econ's like very straight forward graph wise  there isn't that much to deal with  but my group had like different ideas of how they thought the lines would shift and I remember everyone was just kind of in a panic.,0.4491,0.16,0.771,0.069,pp73
We had to double graph four different scenarios  and no one knew what they wanted to do  and we just had to take them two at a time and I like looked at all of the graphs  and there was some things that were similar  just everyone had a different way of going about it  so I like kind of tried to combine all the ideas and we ended up coming up with a graph that was almost a combination of everyone's  so  it worked out in the end.,0.4728,0.056,0.92,0.024,pp73
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp73
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I think what I'd change about myself is that I  I've always grown up a very private person.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
At home  it was just I always felt like my problems and my issues weren't as important as what other people were dealing with so I tend to deal with them myself  which as you grow older and the problems are just so silly  like a little middle school problem may become a lot more weighty when you have so many of them  and so because of that it's  sometimes I get bogged down in myself.,-0.3937,0.079,0.81,0.111,pp73
And I never let it affect my work because I don't want anyone else to be burdened by it  but after a while it gets very overwhelming  and so I wish that I'd just be more willing to share that with people.,0.7353,0.149,0.79,0.062,pp73
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp73
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp73
I think I should get this job because I think there's so many opportunities at this company that I'd really like to be a part of.,0.688,0.191,0.809,0.0,pp73
There's just a lot of chance for growth and a lot of chance also to do something that you love and also make a difference because of it.,0.8689,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp73
I think that the way I deal with problems and working together but also trying to find the best solution and bring people to that level is something that could really benefit the company as well.,0.9431,0.325,0.637,0.038,pp73
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Hi  I'm good  how are you?,0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0,pp74
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp74
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Umm  well  I have been going to MIT for four years now  going to graduate this year  umm  I do computer science and I really enjoy it.,0.6801,0.183,0.817,0.0,pp74
I really like to play music.,0.6659,0.577,0.423,0.0,pp74
I've been involved in several music groups ac-  across campus.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
I play flute  specifically.,0.34,0.444,0.556,0.0,pp74
Umm  and I grew up on a farm in South Dakota.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
It's a great place.,0.6249,0.577,0.423,0.0,pp74
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp74
And  you think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp74
I'd say that I'm a leader  because  often- First  first of all  in my friend group  and  and any group of people  I generally take the lead  and- For example  where we are going to eat  umm.,0.4939,0.082,0.918,0.0,pp74
And  I work in a lab  currently  and I need to direct the project  umm  for writing a  a website to collect music samples from people in Toronto.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Umm  and  I'm primarily directing this project and I work with some grad students  and  I make the plans for how its going to work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp74
So  do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it.,-0.1531,0.085,0.8,0.115,pp74
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp74
Umm  recently I was working  umm  just this last week actually  in a group for my computational biology class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
And  we had some struggles dividing the work.,-0.3612,0.0,0.737,0.263,pp74
It was  it was kind of a difficult thing to  especially since some of us were from a biological background and some of us were from a computational background.,-0.3612,0.0,0.918,0.082,pp74
Umm  we had a hard time deciding the project so that it was equal work for everyone.,-0.1027,0.0,0.92,0.08,pp74
So  it was kind of difficult to resolve that  but what we ended up doing was changing our project.,-0.0249,0.087,0.821,0.092,pp74
Umm  so  I tried to come up with some ways to make sure that everybody had enough  umm  enough work to do based on their backgrounds.,0.3182,0.084,0.916,0.0,pp74
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Umm  I think that  I would like to make myself more comfortable  umm  meeting  new people.,0.7264,0.303,0.697,0.0,pp74
I think that  that would enrich my life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp74
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp74
I think that  I have great background and great experience specifically in the field that  that this job would be for.,0.8481,0.301,0.699,0.0,pp74
And  I really enjoy learning new things  and I think that I'm be good at it.,0.7501,0.313,0.687,0.0,pp74
And  so  in web programming specifically there's always new technologies coming up and so  I'd be really excited learning how to use those.,0.4005,0.109,0.891,0.0,pp74
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
I'm doing well  thanks.,0.6124,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp76
And yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp76
Tell me more about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
Well  I'm Zaynab.,0.2732,0.512,0.488,0.0,pp76
I am a junior in chemical-- majored in chemical engineering at MIT  but I'm doing a minor in energy studies and a fo-- a concentration in anthropology.,0.3919,0.092,0.908,0.0,pp76
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp76
Do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
I think that I am a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
This is because I've held various leadership positions at college thus far  and I think with my leadership  the groups and the organizations that I've been part of have been able to succeed.,0.4939,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp76
For instance  at the moment  I'm the vice president of the African Students Association and the MIT African Students Association as well  a group of 80 students  both international and domestic students.,0.2732,0.063,0.937,0.0,pp76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
So  we're more of a social group  where we throw social events  such as like  cultural shows and study breaks  and things like that  just to get the African students ignited and just united so that they can confront each with whatever problems they have.,0.5267,0.149,0.766,0.084,pp76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
So I guess the most recent event that we had was a cultural show  where we displayed to the entire MIT community just about what it's like to be African like  through-- we did it through performances such as like dancing  singing  spoken word and things like that.,0.8402,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp76
And also  other schools from the Boston/Cambridge area like Harvard  Boston University  Wellesley  and so on  they also came  attendance and that was fun.,0.7003,0.209,0.791,0.0,pp76
That sounds great.,0.6249,0.672,0.328,0.0,pp76
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
Can you give me an example of where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.109,0.795,0.096,pp76
I think the time  like  when there was a conflict in my team was  when I was doing this project for one of my classes  which was in my sophomore year.,0.0516,0.074,0.858,0.068,pp76
So  there was  like  a group of four of us and we all divided the topic evenly so that we could all focus on a specific part of the project.,0.4144,0.087,0.913,0.0,pp76
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
However  there was one person that just wasn't pulling her weight.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
So  I wasn't too sure whether it was just she's stressed or busy with other things  like towards the end of the semester where she just didn't put the effort into doing what she was meant to do.,-0.2173,0.06,0.836,0.104,pp76
So I did confront her about it  and she told me that she hadn't had time to do the necessary work.,-0.2415,0.0,0.911,0.089,pp76
So I just said  just block out some time in your schedule  and let's meet up and let's do the work together  and we were able to produce  um  I guess a very good product at the end of the day.,0.0754,0.071,0.865,0.064,pp76
And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
The option to change one thing?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
I think I would be more outgoing in the terms of speaking  being able to speak to others more freely and confidently  because at the moment  I do speak with people I don't know and do work with people that aren't my friends or aren't in my social circle  but I wish I was more outgoing in the sense of I was more comfortable speaking with other people and interacting with other people  things like that.,0.9594,0.231,0.749,0.02,pp76
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp76
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
I think I should get the job because I have a very strong academic background.,0.5563,0.204,0.796,0.0,pp76
Mmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
I have experiences in different companies thus far in my very short academic career  and I think I've been able to work with a variety of people.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp76
I would be an asset to any team I'm a part of.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp76
How are you today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
I'm doing well  how are you?,0.2732,0.296,0.704,0.0,pp77
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp77
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
So  my background is in mechanical engineering  um  what's  um... and product management  so product development.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Uh  basically  what I'm looking to do now is  uh  find a role that combines product management and  uh  communications skills to be with a technical background as well.,0.2732,0.07,0.93,0.0,pp77
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp77
You think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Yes  um  so  I think leadership doesn't have to be something that always  uh   done in a formal role.,0.4019,0.13,0.87,0.0,pp77
I think leadership is something that you do actively in every part of your life  uh  whether it's taking initiative turning on a light in a dark classroom when no body wants to stand up  something small like that to actually having a formal leadership role  with uh  leading a group and team members.,0.3818,0.083,0.879,0.038,pp77
So  I try to always  uh  stay on top of those things.,0.2023,0.141,0.859,0.0,pp77
So  take initiative if I'm in a group  scheduling a meeting  whether I have a formal role  um  and be on top of things and  uh  be proactive.,0.5574,0.15,0.85,0.0,pp77
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp77
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.1,0.811,0.089,pp77
Definitely.,0.4019,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp77
Uh  so  right now  I'm working on a  I just actually finished a group project that we were doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
And  we had to design this  uh  speech system.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
And  we got to a point within our system where we surveyed a large number of people  it was like 630 people that we surveyed  and we realized that what they wanted was not what we'd designed our system for.,0.4215,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp77
And  so  they wanted a system in which they could basically just review comments and posts.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
It's all from this  uh  inspired by [?,0.4939,0.314,0.686,0.0,pp77
]ISawYou which is this website that MIT students  uh  post missed connections on.,-0.296,0.0,0.845,0.155,pp77
And you can post and you can comment and people can just read.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Well  what we found out was that almost 90% of the people just read the website.,0.2732,0.123,0.877,0.0,pp77
And we were planning on this system where you could post and comment.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Well  we're like wait a minute; this isn't going to work if everybody is just reading the web site.,0.5574,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp77
And  so  half of our group was  wanted to stay with our original plan.,0.3182,0.15,0.85,0.0,pp77
Were like  okay  guys we don't have much time to implement  let's just stick here and go for it.,0.5267,0.206,0.794,0.0,pp77
Then the other half was like  no we have a huge problem  we need to fix it.,-0.0258,0.211,0.573,0.216,pp77
So  uh  what we did was  we just sat down together in a room.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Talked about all the options.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
And really tried to put our  at least I definitely tried to put all my  um  original bias out of the way.,0.5574,0.197,0.748,0.055,pp77
Uh  because I knew that we had a huge conflict going on  one of us was going to have to abandon  there was probably a good idea out there somewhere.,0.0,0.143,0.714,0.143,pp77
Um  so  I just put that behind me and really listened to what all my other team members were saying.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Um  and  it turned out they had a great idea and we just presented today and the system worked out really well.,0.7574,0.245,0.755,0.0,pp77
We changed the direction to fit what our users wanted and  uh  came to a solution that we were all really happy with.,0.8313,0.305,0.695,0.0,pp77
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
One thing about myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
That's a tough one.,-0.128,0.0,0.667,0.333,pp77
I have a tendency sometimes to take on a lot all at once and not.. I will sometimes get bogged down in all the little details of prioritizing all the small fun things that I have to do and not always taking a step back and focusing on  um  the small picture.,0.5106,0.061,0.939,0.0,pp77
But  I'm trying to change that in the way I focus on manage my time  um  really noticing what is it that I'm dedicating my time to  and how can it be better utilized.,0.5927,0.104,0.896,0.0,pp77
Or  what is it that is actually should be a priority.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Um  and how do I reorganize things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
So  I try to do that  um  at least weekly  just look back  you know  what did I do this week  what did I get done  where was I loosing time  what was happening.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Um  to try to make  try to  uh  fix that tendency in myself and  um  hope that becomes habit.,0.4404,0.139,0.861,0.0,pp77
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp77
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
I think I have a lot of qualifications that  um  fit exactly what this job is asking for.,0.3612,0.128,0.872,0.0,pp77
Uh  both the skills to communicate and to manage people and technical background so I understand what's going on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp77
Uh  but  beyond that  I really  I love the company.,0.803,0.409,0.591,0.0,pp77
I love what's happening at the company  I'm inspired by the work here.,0.8126,0.402,0.598,0.0,pp77
And for me  it's really important that I not only enjoy the work I'm doing  but also the people I'm doing it with.,-0.0689,0.063,0.862,0.074,pp77
And so far  everyone that I've met  I've loved them.,0.5994,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp77
And it's been a really great experience.,0.659,0.423,0.577,0.0,pp77
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
I'm doing well  how are you?,0.2732,0.296,0.704,0.0,pp78
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
I'm uh a junior in computer science.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
I used to be a chemistry major  so last summer I worked in a chemistry lab synthesizing pharmaceuticals.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
But now I'm taking more computer science classes and I'm interested in software.,0.5499,0.228,0.772,0.0,pp78
Mm okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,pp78
Do you think you are leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Yeah I would say that I'm a leader.,0.296,0.239,0.761,0.0,pp78
I have a lot of leadership positions.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Again the president of my a Capella group and I'm the room assignment chair in my dorm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
So I have to manage people like for the room assignment chair there's an event where I have to make sure that all of the freshman come down to the dining hall at a certain time and then get them to be lead around to the different parts of the dorm.,0.7096,0.126,0.874,0.0,pp78
Mmmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
And then they get to decide where they live.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Oh okay.,0.2263,0.655,0.345,0.0,pp78
Um do you consider yourself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp78
Yeah so eh I would consider myself a team player.,0.296,0.196,0.804,0.0,pp78
In my a Capella group often times there are different disagreements about how we want to sing a certain song like whether a certain part should be loud or quiet and we have to discuss it instead of just arguing over the details.,0.0516,0.157,0.728,0.114,pp78
So we've gotten better at figuring out how to settle disputes.,0.2648,0.222,0.631,0.147,pp78
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp78
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Mmmmmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
That's a difficult question.,-0.3612,0.0,0.545,0.455,pp78
Hahaha.,0.5574,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp78
I would probably try to make myself less self conscious.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp78
Because it's uh it sometimes being self conscious gets in the way because it makes me think twice about doing something and then I hesitate too much and don't do something that I should do.,-0.2732,0.0,0.942,0.058,pp78
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp78
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp78
Because I'm enthusiastic and I'm good at problem solving and I like Facebook a lot {laughs} {laughs} Okay.,0.9393,0.603,0.313,0.084,pp78
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  Good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp79
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp79
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Related to self or career or… Just in general.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Tell me about yourself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Ok  um  so my name Jessica Aria and I come from  uh  India.,0.296,0.155,0.845,0.0,pp79
I come from IT thinking and I do computers.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I then did chemical engineering in Europe and Indonesia which I found amazing.,0.5859,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp79
So  I was like  maybe this is what I want to do.,0.4703,0.289,0.711,0.0,pp79
So  I shifted over to computer science  um  and I’m a junior right now.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
It’s been going great.,0.6249,0.577,0.423,0.0,pp79
I’m generally interested in  um  in energy education  recently  robotics um.,0.5859,0.348,0.652,0.0,pp79
And  uh   What I  um  I hope to do  I’m not particulary clear about what I want to do after that.,0.2537,0.172,0.738,0.09,pp79
Hopefully  eventually  something enterprenurial.,0.4019,0.474,0.526,0.0,pp79
And definitely including something I experience with before that.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,pp79
Depending on how that goes I may not stick with academics after that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  I’ve always been super excited about that and doing projects that actually make a difference to  you know  people.,0.743,0.259,0.741,0.0,pp79
That’s kind of what I want to do.,0.0772,0.157,0.843,0.0,pp79
But how I want to do it  um  is not yet been foregone.,0.1154,0.108,0.892,0.0,pp79
Do you think you’re a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  I do  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Well  there is all that said  sorts definitions of leadership.,0.2732,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp79
I do believe  um  that I have had the good fortune of being a leader  um  in numerous student clubs  and in high school  and even at MIT.,0.4404,0.097,0.903,0.0,pp79
Um  even in the presence of graduate students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  I’ve managed to sort of  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Obivously  they know more academically  but  um  I’ve still managed to like hold my ground.,0.5023,0.188,0.812,0.0,pp79
Oh  and because I think I’m involved in a lot of stuff that goes on on campus  stuff  that’s just  and um  that’s what sort of made me realize that  um  I do like people.,0.3612,0.068,0.932,0.0,pp79
I like working with people  and I like generally working on a team.,0.6124,0.312,0.688,0.0,pp79
I do believe I’m good enough to sort of lead and at the same time technical enough to sort of understand what it is that we want to achieve.,0.4939,0.135,0.865,0.0,pp79
And convince everyone  and have this mutual consensus that this is how we should do it.,0.25,0.118,0.882,0.0,pp79
Mmmm  ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.104,0.803,0.092,pp79
Um  so yeah definitely  I feel like  I like working with teams  I like people.,0.8995,0.565,0.435,0.0,pp79
I work with um  and example related to a class I took.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I don’t remember the name of it exactly  but it was something related to mobile development.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
We had to make an app as part of the class and one of our ideas was that if you have the I-phones and you could kind of bump the two of them together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
It was kind of a novel idea in relation to what everyone else was doing in terms of photo sharing and meeeting friends.,0.802,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp79
I was required with the technical expertise.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
There was this new thing that was developed at MIT’s regional lab called SWIPE which I had basically allowed you to swipe from one phone to another for data sharing.,0.4215,0.088,0.912,0.0,pp79
It was to get data across.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
It wasn’t really what we wanted  but we thought it was a good start.,0.5927,0.228,0.772,0.0,pp79
A couple of members on my team knew the people that started it and one girl on my team was particular gung ho about it  um  the four the us.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
One guy was experienced and super excited to be trying new stuff.,0.743,0.387,0.613,0.0,pp79
Another experienced programmer was relatively alright with this  and then there was me who was sort of relatively alright.,0.4033,0.179,0.821,0.0,pp79
Um  and there was someone else who was a freshman at the time and she was basically ok with every idea that we said.,0.296,0.087,0.913,0.0,pp79
Right  right  exactly.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Intervieweee: So  um  and he really wanted to use it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
But  after a few tries he realized it wasn’t working.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
And  we went back to the people who made sky- uh  SWIPE  and they said maybe it’s not read for production yet  and maybe you should stop using.,-0.296,0.0,0.925,0.075,pp79
While the other member of my team still wanted to keep using it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  we had to sit back  but we had to still complete the project  so um we had to deal with somehow understanding where he comes from  and we had to sort of do something about it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
We had a meeting that resolved it  um  and we had to sort of say  “this is why we think SWIPE is cool  but this is also why we think we should not use it.” We had to complain that  um  that link is like swipe  but it would not do what we needed it to.,0.25,0.102,0.846,0.053,pp79
Over a series of meetings  he came to realize that um  it evolved  that you know  um  we had to stick to the group.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
And we would say something like  “maybe you could do this link real quick for me ” and he had to realize  like  “maybe I can.” (laughter).,0.802,0.255,0.745,0.0,pp79
So  he was like  it was a very short time to get him to sort of fix it.,0.4144,0.14,0.86,0.0,pp79
Oh  ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
So  we would not use SWIPE but thought of something that thought pushes and you know.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Ok  great.,0.743,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp79
If you were going to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I  so  well  I would actually change  even though this is in the past.,0.3384,0.155,0.845,0.0,pp79
I would  have a deeper understanding understanding of math.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
That sounds really strange I know.,-0.2716,0.0,0.705,0.295,pp79
But  what I consider myself intuitive in general  I understand the concept.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I would want to know  what to do  in that situation.,0.0772,0.115,0.885,0.0,pp79
But  in other situations  I realize  this is a really into academics.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I realize that having a superior understanding of mathematics is so key.,0.5423,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp79
Uh  huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  I really believe I have a good understanding.,0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,pp79
I just really wish I had done more of that  um you know  when I was littler.,0.4576,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp79
I wish I had just like known what I wanted to do when I was really little so I could have actually started working on it.,0.6369,0.178,0.822,0.0,pp79
But  that being said  that’s not something that’s not something  that’s something I’m already working towards shifting.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Mm mm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I’ve already gotten a lot better at  you know understanding  you know  the theory behind the math.,0.4404,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp79
Um  and definitely by the time  you know  I graduate  um  ready for this to will have changed.,0.6369,0.245,0.755,0.0,pp79
You know  some people have been doing it since  they were  you know  five  and I kind of been doing it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
This is not what I understand right now  but last year I sort of could.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I’m in my last semester  as in three classes away from completing my computer science degree.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
So  that makes me feel like I can do that.,0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,pp79
I wish I had done it a lot earlier.,0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,pp79
Oh  ok.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
Um  well  it’s because  first it’s about  first it’s because I’m super excited about working in this industry  and definitely in this company working with great people.,0.9349,0.409,0.591,0.0,pp79
Um  I think there is a lot to be learned from that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
And  those two factors really is  basically  uh  why I want it.,0.0772,0.106,0.894,0.0,pp79
And  as to why I should get it  and it’s because I can learn really quickly and um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
I believe that I’m a team player  and um  and try to really fix things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp79
And  I would like to quote one of my professors who said either you’re building the product  or selling it  or getting in the way.,0.3612,0.094,0.906,0.0,pp79
So  I definitely feel that  um  I could be  um  building the product really well  um  and to contribute in general.,0.6566,0.22,0.78,0.0,pp79
Positively  with your message.,0.5267,0.531,0.469,0.0,pp79
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp79
Please tell me about your background.,0.3182,0.315,0.685,0.0,pp8
So I am a Junior at M.I.T  Ah  I am in computer science and I have taken several classes in Algorithms and in [xx]Nessus six  Uhum and I am also doing studying on my own machine and I plan on taking that next semester before summer starts umm to develop data analysis and machine running skills .,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Especially in field of pattern recognition which I am very interest in.,0.5095,0.23,0.77,0.0,pp8
And uh I hope that will give me some training for internship that I will do in that field.,0.4404,0.139,0.861,0.0,pp8
ah That will give me more practice in the real world  I totally agree.,0.4201,0.177,0.823,0.0,pp8
Do you think you are a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
I think I am.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
I think I am a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Ah I have lead several projects in the past ah As in my position as that community service chair and um  and one in my ah fraternity pledge class and the other in my ah in the student group that I am part of.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
The South Asian American Student Corp and successfully completed.,0.4939,0.286,0.714,0.0,pp8
um  Service  projects with the community as well as organizing ah events for ah raising money for charity Umhum  ah and also for school projects.,0.5994,0.176,0.824,0.0,pp8
I frequently ah I am good at assigning tasks keeping people on task and um as well as gathering input from everybody um which I think are the essential quality of a good leader  Umhum do you consider yourself a team player?,0.7845,0.168,0.832,0.0,pp8
Can you give you an example when there is a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it .,0.0772,0.109,0.795,0.096,pp8
I do consider myself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Ah Going back to the example of my pledge class from my fraternity.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
uh we had several tasks.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
One of which would be to visit every other every student in the pledge class.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Storm week  this was during freshman year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Umhum and with a pledge class has  13 people it is not a impossible task but there were logistical problem.,-0.5499,0.0,0.843,0.157,pp8
One communication trying to get everybody to participate another is  figuring  out the best way to go about things.,0.6369,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp8
People wanting to  meet in the middle ect.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
So I did my part as a team member to lead people to my room and show up myself.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
um But a good team player should also make sure that other people are doing their job.,0.7783,0.312,0.688,0.0,pp8
ah Not necessarily in a lead or a managerial role.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
But with the same general properties as a leader ah that all the team members should be checking one another and so I ah pardon that to um when there was several members missing I would ah say hey you call this person and I will call this person.,0.1395,0.063,0.884,0.053,pp8
Split up tasks etc.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Ah and also help in planning  with what's  the best route to go by etc.,0.7845,0.347,0.653,0.0,pp8
That makes sense.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
If you given  the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
If I had to change one thing about myself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Yes  Naturally there are a lot of thing I wish i could  change about myself.,0.6597,0.293,0.707,0.0,pp8
I wish I could do better at basketball.,0.6808,0.483,0.517,0.0,pp8
(Snicker} But ah I think if I had to pick one quality it would probably be my ah  abillity to stay focused on a task  Although I am pretty efficient at ah getting things done and I do create ideas sometimes I get distracted or I like to multitask so I might be staying on task with work in general but I'll like to  have three different homework sessions going on at once and find this one and this.,0.9549,0.215,0.753,0.032,pp8
A lot of times that will work really well  for me but if I working collaboratively that may not work best for other people.,-0.5934,0.06,0.779,0.161,pp8
So making myself more adaptive to other peoples study styles working styles etc  that would probably help me a lot  Uhum Thank you.,0.6369,0.198,0.802,0.0,pp8
So why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
I think I should get this job because ah for two main reasons.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
One because I would provide a lot the company because I am very efficient at working.,0.4754,0.171,0.829,0.0,pp8
I can think creatively for new ideas.,0.3612,0.294,0.706,0.0,pp8
Say for new ways to analyse certain new data or to optimize the running of the ah of certain ah software.,0.7506,0.291,0.709,0.0,pp8
ah On the other hand.,0.4939,0.444,0.556,0.0,pp8
The other reason I should get this job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp8
Is because I would be a valuable member of valuable member of the workplace in this field I think by getting more experience um with this start up I think I would ah Really would  help me with my study skills that would help me in the future  Well thank you for coming today,0.938,0.256,0.744,0.0,pp8
[inaudible] Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Fine  thank you.,0.5106,0.811,0.189,0.0,pp80
How about yourself?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp80
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
So  I'm from Berkley  California.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And I came to MIT to study bioengineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And it's been a really great education because I've learned to combine like engineering skills  real world skills with all this academic knowledge  um  and especially true in my lab where the combination between hands-on research and like thinking about how the research is working has really come together to improve my understanding of science and medicine.,0.937,0.228,0.772,0.0,pp80
Wonderful.,0.5719,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp80
And you think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
I think I have great leadership potential.,0.6249,0.406,0.594,0.0,pp80
Uh  I am currently head of the Greek MedLinks at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And what MedLinks is  is this really great program where we serve as the liaison between students and healthcare facilities.,0.659,0.188,0.812,0.0,pp80
MIT has so much support  so much support.,0.7146,0.498,0.502,0.0,pp80
And there is...I mean we have...the students have great access to it.,0.6249,0.272,0.728,0.0,pp80
But a lot of times we don't know to look for it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Right?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
It can be right in front of your face  and if you're not looking  it's not there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
So we do a lot of outreach stuff.,0.2732,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp80
And I as head of the Greek MedLinks  uh  I really try and encourage people in their fraternities and sororities to  uh   get involve with their  the people that they assess and teach them a lot about nutrition and health.,0.552,0.084,0.916,0.0,pp80
And then I organize inter-Greek MedLinks events.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
So this has really improved my leadership because it helped me learn to do organizational skills and really learn to listen to feedback because you can't lead people that don't want to be led.,0.489,0.093,0.874,0.033,pp80
Right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp80
So  do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp80
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp80
So  I think team work is...the only way to get anything done...right  an individual  what are you going to do?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Um  so  I played on the golf team in high school.,0.3976,0.211,0.789,0.0,pp80
And we're a close-knit team.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
But golf is a mental game and sometimes it can get to your head if you're not playing well  and you just play worse.,-0.6321,0.099,0.638,0.263,pp80
And it's a downward spiral.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And you're with someone out on the course for five hours.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And if you have like a little feud between each other  you're still going to be stuck with that person for five hours.,-0.1548,0.094,0.752,0.154,pp80
And one time my teammate was playing not as well.,-0.0036,0.155,0.689,0.156,pp80
And it was a pressured situation.,-0.2263,0.0,0.725,0.275,pp80
And we have  you have a break in between  2 1/2 half hours.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And the rest of the team was doing pretty well but she wasn't.,0.3919,0.249,0.751,0.0,pp80
And they were sort of pressuring her to do better.,0.0534,0.213,0.589,0.198,pp80
And I sort of said  Well  guys like it's going to make her do worse  you know  so let up.,0.0534,0.176,0.697,0.127,pp80
And we joked around and that really helped resolve the conflict.,0.4364,0.335,0.517,0.149,pp80
So  I think it's important to like understand that the angle is more important than your own personal goal like winning this trophy.,0.8832,0.406,0.594,0.0,pp80
It's more important to be like be cohesive and  function as a unit.,0.5563,0.295,0.705,0.0,pp80
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
So  I'm not great with administrative work.,-0.5511,0.0,0.628,0.372,pp80
Hm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
I have trouble with like little menial deadlines and all this writing and signatures and getting everything organized.,-0.0516,0.118,0.755,0.127,pp80
It stresses me out.,-0.4588,0.0,0.5,0.5,pp80
But I'm learning to deal with it by electronics...ah!,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
The new age!,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
It is my savior.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
I had...with the new iMac and iPhone and the way they interconnect means that if I have to do something  there's going to be like six alarms that are going to go and remind me.,0.1027,0.066,0.878,0.056,pp80
And so with my computer and my phone so if I can't hear one  I can probably  probably would [inaudible] the other.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
So  that's really helped.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
It helped relieve the stress.,-0.0772,0.301,0.361,0.337,pp80
Knowing that I'm going to be reminded is almost enough to take my mind off of it so I can focus on what I'm doing.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And  uh  why do you think you should get into medical school?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
Well  I think I should go to medical school because I love people  and I love to help  and I've got the academic background for it.,0.9217,0.375,0.625,0.0,pp80
I'm not afraid to work hard and put in long hours.,-0.1027,0.0,0.877,0.123,pp80
Medicine is fascinating surrounded by all these diseases that...I mean we've made such great progress  but there's just more that we can study.,0.6908,0.251,0.749,0.0,pp80
So  I'm currently studying in my lab  uh  work in an HIV lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp80
And that really inspired me to go into medicine because  you know  I'm looking at all these cutting-edge technologies and it's like I want to be right where they're being implemented  not just on the research side but on the people side as well.,0.7,0.163,0.837,0.0,pp80
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp80
So tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Um  I am a sophomore at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Um  I'm studying brain and cognitive science  with a minor in biology.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Right now I’m working in a lab that is more of a narrow cognition lab.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
We work  um  basically to try to figure out pathways in the brain that process different functions.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Um  it’s a longitudinal study.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Um  so it’s something I’m really interested in.,0.4576,0.3,0.7,0.0,pp81
But I think moving forward I’m going to try to start working with from a pharmacology aspect  because it’s such an emerging field.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Um  that’s mainly where I want to go  because I hope to eventually work  um  in [??],0.5514,0.233,0.767,0.0,pp81
and so pharmacology would be very important for that field.,0.2716,0.189,0.811,0.0,pp81
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp81
And do you think you’re a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
I think I am a leader  in a sense that I see people as people  and I see tasks as tasks  and I know how to communicate effectively between how to get these tasks done and how to get the people to do them.,0.4404,0.063,0.937,0.0,pp81
And I think I’m a good motivator  good communicator  and I’m also very detail-oriented.,0.7003,0.326,0.674,0.0,pp81
So it helps me better able to break down  um  people in order to delegate  um  more fundamentals or specific tasks  in order to get them done more effectively.,0.839,0.257,0.743,0.0,pp81
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp81
And do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Can you give me an example where there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.114,0.786,0.1,pp81
Yes  I consider myself a team player  because I do think I’m very fair and always open to what other people are thinking.,0.6478,0.201,0.799,0.0,pp81
So in [??],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
movement  which is an on-campus student group which basically seeks to provide inner city Boston high school students with better access to reading and math comprehension to help better prepare them for the SAT test.,0.8176,0.21,0.79,0.0,pp81
We meet with three or four of them once a week on a Sunday.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
And large groups  so they’re  like  small groups that two members are on a charter.,0.4173,0.166,0.834,0.0,pp81
So I’m part of a two-person team  and then we all meet together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
So I would sometimes disagree with my partner as well as the [??],-0.2168,0.131,0.685,0.184,pp81
as a whole in terms of what we should be teaching and what we should be focusing on  whether we should look more at science  whether we should have more holistic education versus just teaching to the SAT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
I think that basically what I was trying to do was explain my point.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
If the group thought that what I was saying had some merit and liked to incorporate it I would feel good.,0.8176,0.321,0.679,0.0,pp81
But if they didn’t  then I would accept the fact that that was the way they felt; and  you know  majority rules and I didn’t have any hard feelings.,0.4215,0.106,0.844,0.05,pp81
At the end of the day I wanted what’s best for the kids.,0.6369,0.259,0.741,0.0,pp81
So in a sense I am a team player because I want what’s best for the project as a whole.,0.6705,0.234,0.766,0.0,pp81
It’s not just all about me and getting my point across.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp81
And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
I definitely think it would be making myself more organized.,0.4019,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp81
So I’m extremely detail-oriented  and I see exactly what needs to be done and the timeline it needs to get done.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
But I guess since I’m involved in so many things  being a student  as well as in a sorority  as well as pursuing various academic endeavors  I think that  um  sometimes that bogs me down.,0.6486,0.138,0.862,0.0,pp81
Knowing exactly what I need to get done and what timeline  and then I get overstretched.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
But I think that’s an easy problem to fix.,0.0772,0.267,0.486,0.247,pp81
Um  and so far as we  you know  you get more specialized over the course of our lives.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
I definitely have a path that is more specialized that I intend to pursue.,0.4019,0.172,0.828,0.0,pp81
So that won’t be a problem  and I think just maintaining basic organizational structure definitely helps me  but it would be a lot easier if I didn’t have to maintain anything and that was just naturally the way I was  so... OK.,0.6705,0.156,0.805,0.039,pp81
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp81
I think that I have… I’m very interested in what your company is doing  and I’m very interested in what this project specifically is related to  but I also think I have a lot to offer the group as well.,0.6851,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp81
I am a MIT student who’s given a very specific set of problems and some solving skills that would be very unique to the group.,-0.0772,0.085,0.819,0.096,pp81
But I’m also very outgoing and very interested in interpersonal relationships and I think that could help me convey our message as well as work with the technical aspect of the team.,0.925,0.324,0.676,0.0,pp81
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  pretty good  pretty good.,0.9042,0.924,0.076,0.0,pp83
Getting busy with studying for finals.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Oh  I'm sure.,0.3182,0.535,0.465,0.0,pp83
So tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  alright  so  I  I've been studying at MIT for three years.,0.25,0.154,0.846,0.0,pp83
I initially started as a physics major actually  so sophomore year I took  um  a couple physics classes in relativity  um  waves and vibrations.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Uh  and then one of the classes that had been recommended to me was computational neuroscience  which also counts for physics department.,0.2023,0.079,0.921,0.0,pp83
So  um  after that was intro to neuroscience.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
So I took that  fell in love with neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience  so... I started taking more classes in that.,0.6369,0.181,0.819,0.0,pp83
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp83
And do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  I'm working on it  um  definitely.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp83
Uh  I mean  I do  I do like working in a team as equal group members  um  I feel like I can be a leader.,0.6124,0.179,0.821,0.0,pp83
Uh  for example  this past summer I was in China  and  uh  they let me  uh  teach a classroom of 60 students.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  and so that really help to strengthen my leadership skills  just in terms of classroom management and getting everyone to work together as a group.,0.7023,0.195,0.805,0.0,pp83
That's great.,0.6249,0.804,0.196,0.0,pp83
And do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?,0.0772,0.104,0.803,0.092,pp83
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp83
Um  I feel like I  I  um  so  uh  in that last summer as well in China  we had sort of a problem.,0.1548,0.167,0.725,0.108,pp83
Uh  we were trying to get some videos up on a website... Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
...um  none of us had any computer science background  and so  um  I tried to find a student who had both computer science background and spoke English to a level where we could  like  actually communicate... Right.,0.3612,0.065,0.935,0.0,pp83
Um  so  uh  I participated in that  in that kind of way.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Hmm... let's see.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  I'd say  probably  I get kind of nervous sometimes.,-0.3384,0.0,0.79,0.21,pp83
Um  I'd say I'd like to calm down a little bit.,0.5859,0.348,0.652,0.0,pp83
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Uh I mean  sometimes it's good  like  I... I have lots of energy  but sometimes it's just a bit too much.,0.5023,0.226,0.774,0.0,pp83
[laughs] Uh-huh.,0.4939,0.762,0.238,0.0,pp83
To be able to [??].,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Uh-huh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
And why do you think you should get the job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Um  so  I mean  I'm very committed  but on top of that I have a very strong academic background.,0.831,0.354,0.646,0.0,pp83
I've done research before in this area... Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
And  um  in a similar field  but sort of  um  also different.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
So I think I come in with a different sort of perspective to this.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
OK.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
And also  I mean  I come in with  like  some physics background.,0.3612,0.185,0.815,0.0,pp83
So I think that additionally provides a different perspective on brain and cognitive science that isn't always seen.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp83
That sort of  like  very analytical way of thinking  and  like  seeing things at the most fundamental level  I bring that perspective in.,0.5729,0.183,0.817,0.0,pp83
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp83
How are you doing today?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Good thank you  how are you?,0.6597,0.574,0.426,0.0,pp84
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp84
Tell me more about your background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Alright  well  so I'm originally from Australia.,0.4767,0.451,0.549,0.0,pp84
And um  since then my family and I have moved around a lot so I would consider myself an international citizen.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
I'm actually not an American citizen.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Um  but I've been here studying at MIT material science for uh  three years now and I'm enjoying it.,0.6808,0.204,0.796,0.0,pp84
Um  it's helped me figure out that I'm really interested in engineering and I'm really loving having a bit of material science as well as mechanical engineering which is what I'm doing a minor it.,0.8514,0.225,0.775,0.0,pp84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp84
Do you think you're a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Tell me why.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Yes  definitely.,0.6597,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp84
Um  well I can tell you that I was told that at a leadership conference that I went to earlier this year.,0.2732,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp84
Um  we classified personalities in team-working situations and I was definitely one of the more leader type one people where I work well with a team but I like have things  I like to do things well my way or I like to at least be...if I want to see something done right then want to  I would like to do it right.,0.9581,0.289,0.711,0.0,pp84
Um  then I've had a lot of chance to practice that and I would say that I've gotten pretty good at incorporating that personality type with other types of personalities in teamwork situations.,0.7964,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp84
So  for example I'm  um  co-president  I've recently been elected president of Amnesty International here on campus and I  so I've had a lot of experience with that group up until now working with them  trying to lead a team  trying to help them take initiative for themselves  trying to encourage them as well as be a leader by example and do all of  as much as I can uh  handle comfortably to make the club a success.,0.9274,0.167,0.833,0.0,pp84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp84
Do you consider yourself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.,0.0772,0.1,0.811,0.089,pp84
Okay  um well.,0.4588,0.8,0.2,0.0,pp84
Yeah  um  Amnesty International is another good example.,0.6249,0.459,0.541,0.0,pp84
We've had a few tensions between personalities.,-0.4019,0.0,0.69,0.31,pp84
Um  the year before  so last year  we had two co-presidents and one of them was a pretty opinionated person  someone who had strong feelings toward his vision for the club and just went for it with all like  all of his effort into that one direction and just didn't really look back and didn't look around to see how other people felt about it.,0.875,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp84
Which  I was okay with because I saw his direction being really beneficial for the club  um  but we had another member of the team who was not okay with that.,0.14,0.106,0.835,0.06,pp84
She felt also that she had a lot to give and she felt like none of her ideas were being heard.,0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,pp84
So  they would actually get into some tense email situations and there was a bit of tension in the group.,-0.5719,0.0,0.793,0.207,pp84
But  it actually kind of became resolved during elections this year.,0.2617,0.17,0.83,0.0,pp84
Um  they worked together fairly well during the semester  um  especially when they weren't both in the same room at the same time  just working via email it was good.,0.6124,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp84
And then today  uh  sorry  this week during elections it kind of all came out into the open and now that he's not president any more and she's in the same role as treasurer  um  it's been resolved.,0.2263,0.081,0.886,0.033,pp84
Um  I guess my role in that was just kind of being uh  the team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Just trying to make whatever we trying to do work successfully so that there was no added tension from our efforts being a failure.,-0.0869,0.168,0.652,0.179,pp84
Great.,0.6249,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp84
And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Oh  interesting question.,0.4019,0.574,0.426,0.0,pp84
I  I would like to be a better public speaker  actually.,0.6597,0.375,0.625,0.0,pp84
I would really like to be able to synthesize my thoughts quickly and coherently.,0.4201,0.177,0.823,0.0,pp84
Um  I think that would make me a better writer and I think that in general being a great at communicating is one of the strongest skills that you can have to convince people to  to just make whatever project you're working on be a success.,0.9393,0.276,0.724,0.0,pp84
To convince investors to invest money  to obtain partnerships and sponsorships  to be a good leader  to inspire...I think  I would love to be able to just have an infinite vocabulary and have a very  you know  better way of presenting my ideas.,0.9055,0.239,0.761,0.0,pp84
And why do you think you should get the job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
Um  I do think I am qualified for the job because I've had a lot of experience in this industry.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp84
I've worked in research in material science for the last two summers as well as I've had a lot of leadership experience  um  not just in Amnesty International but also in my sorority.,0.1406,0.046,0.954,0.0,pp84
And um  what was the other one  I was an orientation leader for um  orientation at MIT  which was a cool experience.,0.3182,0.099,0.901,0.0,pp84
So  um  I've had a lot different ways to develop my team-working skills and I'd really like to put those to work in industry-based projects now um  which I've seen a lot of but I've never had a chance to actually try it out.,-0.055,0.041,0.913,0.046,pp84
So  I'm excited to try that.,0.3976,0.349,0.651,0.0,pp84
Please tell me about your background Okay  well I'm a junior here at MIT.,0.6486,0.364,0.636,0.0,pp85
Umm  I'm double-majoring courses ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
which is uh  the ?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
computer science and bioengineering  and I guess those are two very different things  so I get alot of questions about why  and I think it's um  because I came to MIT thinking I wanted to do bioengineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
And then I guess I just feel like I everyone around here like  has some relation to programming sometime  and then I took a programming class  got bit by the bug  and then I just like  I loved it.,0.886,0.246,0.754,0.0,pp85
And then  so last year  I decided to double major  cause um  I'm actually interested in a lot of I guess there is an overlap  between like biocircuits as well as just modeling biological systems with computer science  so um it was a really good opportunity here  so yeah.,0.9333,0.272,0.728,0.0,pp85
Oh  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,pp85
So uh  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Can you tell me whY?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Um  I do think I'm a leader  and then I guess that's one of the things  me coming to MIT  I wouldn't have said I'm a leader necessarily  even though like I guess I was like  did some things in high school.,0.6124,0.111,0.889,0.0,pp85
But um  I think that's one of the things I'  really thankful from MIT  it's really developed my ability to be confident  as well as um  I think just to motivate other people and uh  and it's like  just like  if I wanted to get something done like I think something really... like I think something really cool will happen with some ideea  then what I'll do is I'll  like  get a couple of people together  like get them motivated by  uh  figuring out what needs to get done logistically and just like  assign people  I think a timeline and stuff like that?,0.9948,0.376,0.624,0.0,pp85
And  I think um  my experience at MIT has  uh  like really given me that experience and as well as actually just allowing me to find these people that  cause there's a lot of really awesome people here and usually willing to do the exact same thing.. or you tell them about other ideas and they're really excited about it just like you are.,0.9214,0.194,0.806,0.0,pp85
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Mmm  good.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp85
So do you consider yourself a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Can you tell me a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge?,0.0772,0.075,0.925,0.0,pp85
How did you go about resolving it?,0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0,pp85
So yeah  so I think  um  what like one of the things I guess obviously is you have to be able to take direction just as well as you give it  otherwise you're team can't function.,0.7264,0.177,0.823,0.0,pp85
And  so I guess um one of the times I was on a team was um for example ah  in a fraternity and for the fall we have rush  which is basically all...we have 26 fraternities at MIT  there's a 1 000 incoming freshman.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
You're essentially like all  somehow  competing almost for them but ah I guess one of the other things you're just looking for the people that are a good fit for you  but you want to meet as many people as possible.,0.8519,0.218,0.782,0.0,pp85
So I think one of the things that is you have to be able to take direction from your  from our rush chair.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
So it's  sometimes he needs you just to go out on campus and try to get random freshman to the house.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Sometimes you just need to go talk to people at the house  and then  like  just have a converstaion with them and learn more about them.,0.3612,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp85
Sometimes you just need to clean dishes from the food event cause we need to get the next event  so I think  um  just being able to...willing to take direction just doing anything and not losing track of the bigger goal is  I think  what makes me a good team player.,0.7772,0.14,0.86,0.0,pp85
Oh excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,pp85
Which house are you?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
INterviewee:  Ah  Alpha Delta Phi?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
It's right in Central Square.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Ah  yes  yes I'm familiar with it.,0.6597,0.519,0.481,0.0,pp85
Lot of nice restaurants.,0.4215,0.483,0.517,0.0,pp85
'laugh' 'laugh' I know  I've been to the house.,0.802,0.507,0.493,0.0,pp85
Um  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Ah  that's  uh  a really interesting question.,0.4576,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp85
Um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
I think I would make myself  ah  maybe a little bit better  I think  just in um social sitatuions with strangers.,0.3862,0.116,0.884,0.0,pp85
Um  sometimes I just can get a little bit  like  anxious.,0.1243,0.171,0.695,0.134,pp85
Uh.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
For example I hate  like  bit networking events  because like I never really know how to  like  walk up to someone  like just maybe like have small talk and then just leave the conversation.,0.765,0.282,0.608,0.11,pp85
That's some of the things that like  I guess I've never really been too extroverted of a person  so I don't really  like  say necessarily  good at just meeting lots of new people  getting them like  making a memorable impression or something like that?,0.8391,0.234,0.722,0.044,pp85
So I think  um  that's one of the the things I've been trying to work on.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
I think that's what's really nice about MIT is  there's a lot of people like that.,0.6801,0.285,0.715,0.0,pp85
There's a lot a research.. there's a lot of  like  lot of ahh  session for people  like there's a bunch of opportunities for networking for people who hate networking and then I think a lot of people have the same or similar just like  philosphy about it.,0.6597,0.181,0.753,0.066,pp85
Um so I think just need to change to be better about that  and just be better at talking to strangers and less apprehensive about approaching people and just starting up a conversation.,0.7003,0.158,0.842,0.0,pp85
Mm-hmm.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
There's definitely a thing one can work on  there's definitly a...?,0.4019,0.213,0.787,0.0,pp85
Ok  so think what job you'd like to have.,0.5719,0.402,0.598,0.0,pp85
So  why do you think you should get this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Ok  so I guess um  right now I'm looking for some software internships for the summer  and I think why I should have that job is just because I think I've gotten the technical background from like  algorithms classes  like software engineering classes?,0.7351,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp85
But then I've also had  um  the experiences of working as a team at MIT  like  uh  I'm on student government  um  with my fraternity  as well  as uh  I guess I'm pretty independent.,0.8807,0.248,0.752,0.0,pp85
I think MIT really develops everybody  you choose your own classes  like your own activities?,0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,pp85
And I think I'm very self-sufficient so I thnk uh  for like  maybe like super.. I've like  mabye supervised peers in previous internships  and I think I would just be able to like  take a project.,0.9169,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp85
I'm not afraid to ask a question if I need direction  and I mostly  like I can just work alone so I think it's be very helpful for  I guess  just like a supervisor cause then they don't have to check up on me all the time and uh  but then uh the would also know that I would go to them when needed.,0.4672,0.083,0.895,0.022,pp85
Uh  also  I'm very thourough  so I would  like I don't like leaving things  like if there's a small  mistake I'll like  even if it takes a long time  I'll make sure that I can iron it out  so I think for  code-wise  that's really nice for testing in that it's often more bug-free.,0.8247,0.203,0.727,0.07,pp85
So.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp85
Oh  excellent.,0.5719,0.787,0.213,0.0,pp85
Thank you for interviewing here today.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp85
Thank you.,0.3612,0.714,0.286,0.0,pp85
In my technical background  um.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Been a junior at MIT.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  I studied a lot of music  but I've been mainly studying robotics  mechanical engineering and a little bit of electrical uh  at MIT here.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
So  uh  I've done a few robot competitions  built a few  and um  you know  that's basically what I do  build robots and play music.,0.34,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp86
Excellent  yeah.,0.7096,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp86
So  do you think you're a leader?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Can you tell me why?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
I think I am a leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  because um  I'm very calm.,0.3804,0.341,0.659,0.0,pp86
And I don't over react and I'm very good at  I wouldn't  handling is the wrong word.,0.024,0.15,0.704,0.146,pp86
But I guess  you know  dealing with people and making sure that they can relate with other people.,0.4497,0.148,0.852,0.0,pp86
Making a team work.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
That type of stuff.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  I like to think I'm pretty sociable.,0.8225,0.632,0.368,0.0,pp86
Um  I'm a nice guy and I'm easy to talk to and I think those are all very nice traits for a leader.,0.8313,0.305,0.695,0.0,pp86
Mm-Hm So  I would say yes  I'm a good leader and based on previous leadership experience I say that I did a pretty good job  so.,0.8934,0.347,0.653,0.0,pp86
Do you think you're a team player?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,pp86
How did you go about solving that challenge?,0.4019,0.381,0.619,0.0,pp86
Um  I  I'd definitely say I'm a good team player.,0.6808,0.412,0.588,0.0,pp86
Now  are you asking about how I worked well with the team  or how well I worked bringing the team together or how well I worked  okay  well uh  I'll address all of them.,0.8074,0.262,0.738,0.0,pp86
Um  I guess  as a team member  I very quickly learned what my role was and asked you know  if there's anything I can do  what do I need to do?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
And I do that  fill that role.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  but I'm also very good at you know  kind of combining all of the roles together.,0.6474,0.211,0.789,0.0,pp86
So  say  let's just  you know  on a robot  for example  there's mechanical  there's electrical  there's  there's code work that also needs to be put together.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
And  everyone can do a great job by themselves.,0.6249,0.339,0.661,0.0,pp86
But if they're not working together then you know  like if I don't know what the guy  the code guy is working on and what energy equations he needs and that type of stuff then I  as an electronic guy or as a mechanical guy like  it's not gonna work.,0.8462,0.163,0.837,0.0,pp86
Um  and that's how I guess I work well within a team is kind of bringing people together.,0.2732,0.11,0.89,0.0,pp86
Um  but  if there are any like  challenges I guess I faced as a team um  I guess  that really wasn't the question though was it.,0.5719,0.164,0.836,0.0,pp86
Could you repeat the question again  I'm sorry.,-0.0772,0.0,0.843,0.157,pp86
Do you consider yourself a team player.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Give me an example where there was a conflict on your team that you had to resolve.,0.0772,0.131,0.754,0.116,pp86
Okay  um  okay  so a recent project I worked on with friends.,0.7096,0.434,0.566,0.0,pp86
Um  there were these two guys.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Love them to death  they're great guys  very talented  Tyler and Dan.,0.8399,0.5,0.336,0.164,pp86
They're very close.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
They've been very close for  I guess freshmen year.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  they have one of those relationships where good  you know  good high points  but there's also like  they fight a lot.,0.4118,0.25,0.63,0.119,pp86
So  um  there were a couple moments where they were just pissed at each other.,-0.6369,0.0,0.769,0.231,pp86
They hated each other.,-0.6369,0.0,0.417,0.583,pp86
They couldn't work well together so  what I did was I kind of you know  told them take  take a step back.,-0.2057,0.0,0.92,0.08,pp86
Tyler  we're gonna go to the student center.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
We're gonna grab some food  chillax and then we're gonna get back.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
And while we were walking to the student center I talked to him about it and talked to what his issues were.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
And then  on the way back  he was much more calm and things progressed a lot smoother and much faster.,0.3804,0.12,0.88,0.0,pp86
I would say.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Mm-hm  well  well  this helps.,0.7003,0.773,0.227,0.0,pp86
So  if you were to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
One thing  okay.,0.2263,0.487,0.513,0.0,pp86
Um  I would say  time management.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Mm-hm Definitely time management.,0.4019,0.474,0.526,0.0,pp86
Um  it's been rough my whole life.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um I'd say it's definitely been getting better but I've definitely had problems with  I'm very much living in the now and so sometimes I forget to think ahead.,0.0141,0.195,0.638,0.167,pp86
and  um  there have been many instances where I've got into trouble.,-0.4019,0.0,0.803,0.197,pp86
I have a lot of work to do and it's you know coming up in like  a few days.,0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,pp86
And sometimes  I  I should work harder earlier on  but I don't get  you know  I don't get  I'm like  well I could work on it  but I've done enough tonight.,-0.0039,0.077,0.845,0.078,pp86
Why don't I  I can figure it out tomorrow.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
And usually end up working really hard um  right at the end.,-0.1761,0.0,0.867,0.133,pp86
Which I guess a lot of people end up doing but  if that was one thing I could change  I'd say definitely better time management  being able to spread it out more evenly and be more prepared.,0.8804,0.231,0.769,0.0,pp86
Now  how about a job you'd like to have?,0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,pp86
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp86
Do you have one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Yeah.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp86
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp86
So  now  why should we give you this job?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Okay.,0.2263,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp86
Um  should I go with  just go with  let my imagination flow?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Sure.,0.3182,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp86
All right.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Okay  so we're at a robotics interview.,0.2263,0.241,0.759,0.0,pp86
Um  well  I think I deserve this job  a lot because I've been working very hard.,0.1045,0.118,0.787,0.095,pp86
I know a ton of control background.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
I know a ton about robotics  mechanical engineering.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  I've had a ton of um  hands-on work with robots.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  and I know all the work that goes into it.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  so as far as background and experience that I've had with robotics  I'd say I'm very well um  informed  I wouldn't say informed.,0.3384,0.094,0.906,0.0,pp86
I  experienced  I don't want to use the word experienced again but that's  I have a lot of experience in robotics.,-0.0286,0.0,0.947,0.053,pp86
Um  and I've  since I've been working with it for such a long time  I can learn more about it quicker and I'm very  I'm very fast to learn.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
So  throw me in a new situation.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
I'll  you know  Oh  okay  I know what that is.,0.2263,0.174,0.826,0.0,pp86
I can relate to that and I just work from there.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp86
Um  and I think I'm a very  I work well with people so robotics is one of those things where you have to work with a bunch of  a group of people for a common goal.,0.3321,0.063,0.937,0.0,pp86
And I'd like to think that I'm very good at working with people so  Mm-hmm Um  and it  it sounds like a fun place to work.,0.8883,0.343,0.657,0.0,pp86
I  I've talked to you know  some friends and some other people working there.,0.4767,0.193,0.807,0.0,pp86
And it's just  I'd really love to work there.,0.6697,0.36,0.64,0.0,pp86
And I think I'm a good fit.,0.6597,0.519,0.481,0.0,pp86
Well thank you.,0.5574,0.821,0.179,0.0,pp86
I appreciate you coming to interview today.,0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp86
Please talk about yourself.,0.3182,0.434,0.566,0.0,pp89
Mhmm uh so is it all right if I kind of talk about the same stuff as last time?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Of course  same person.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
I was going to say  I haven’t changed too much but um yeah so still a junior at MIT here  and um about halfway through junior year and um I’m a physics major and um I’m from Pensacola  Florida and um I’m  yeah so born and raised in Pensacola and I just um uh you know moved up here a couple years ago and started at MIT and I uh  I’m not sure as far as what I’m going to go into career wise but I’m looking at something applied in the physics area.,0.8078,0.095,0.881,0.024,pp89
And um as far as extracurricular go I do a few things.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
I’m involved with a few IM sports that my fraternity does uh  soccer and basketball  and I enjoy juggling and unicycling as well.,0.6486,0.202,0.798,0.0,pp89
I’ve done  I’ve unicylced since 5th grade and I’ve done that a lot and um I’m involved with the juggling club here and I like to play ultimate Frisbee as well from time to time just for fun and um yeah so you know enjoy doing sports in my spare time but uh yeah physics as far as school goes.,0.8684,0.206,0.794,0.0,pp89
Thank you  so uh do you think you’re a leader and tell me why.,0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,pp89
Do I think I’m sorry?,-0.0772,0.0,0.755,0.245,pp89
Leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
A leader.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Oh um yeah in some senses  I like  as far as leadership experience I’ve had  I’ve enjoyed more in the small group type things.,0.7906,0.276,0.724,0.0,pp89
Like I’ve mentioned before in high school I led a small group of students to do a community service project where we organized a math competition.,0.3612,0.091,0.909,0.0,pp89
And um I uh I enjoy doing  um for one of my internships  I worked at a robotics firm and it was a pretty small group  it was 4 or 5 of us but I go to kind of have some leadership on some of the tasks there that was fun.,0.8248,0.153,0.847,0.0,pp89
And uh yeah I mean juggling club is a little bit of a leadership position  there’s a few people I kind of oversee there.,0.296,0.087,0.913,0.0,pp89
And you know those few leadership experiences I’ve had have been really good um you know I guess besides those three  I haven’t had any larger scale leadership experiences with you know more people but those I have enjoyed.,0.7612,0.15,0.85,0.0,pp89
I guess I consider myself a leader in that regard.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Good do you think you’re a team player?,0.4404,0.293,0.707,0.0,pp89
Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge.,0.0772,0.071,0.929,0.0,pp89
How did you solve it?,0.2023,0.31,0.69,0.0,pp89
Yeah um so I mean this past semester I’ve done some team stuff just one on one with a partner for my um lab class.,0.296,0.084,0.916,0.0,pp89
And um so I got to kind of do some team playing there.,0.2023,0.13,0.87,0.0,pp89
But um I guess another time was uh last January I was in Mexico as well but this time it was with an exchange program and it was the whole month and next week I’ll actually going back for fun for a week.,0.7964,0.148,0.852,0.0,pp89
But yeah it was [???],0.5171,0.455,0.545,0.0,pp89
Mexico and it was me and two other students at a high school and we basically got there and we thought they were going to know what we’re supposed to do  it was the first time they had done the program and we get there and they were like  “Okay well what are you guys going to do.” And we were like  “Well we were going to ask you the same thing.” So we kind of had to come together with the three of us and figure out what to do.,0.7269,0.075,0.925,0.0,pp89
So we uh we talked at first and well kind of had familiarity with a lot of different subjects as far as like  especially applications of what these students were learning  calculus and physics and how to demonstrate those.,0.5574,0.111,0.889,0.0,pp89
We decided to each give little lectures on topics that were relevant to what the students were learning they might you know be going to a certain field to apply later on like especially calculus but also the physics classes and stuff.,0.3182,0.076,0.924,0.0,pp89
I ended up doing two main things  I gave a few physics demonstrations uh and you know they had some equipment there  I just talked about vectors and how to halve those and force equations.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
And then you know we had a couple weights and walked through the class how to predict how it would work out and actually measured it and so that was cool.,0.3744,0.079,0.921,0.0,pp89
All three of the students collaborated on what we should talk about because we kind of were familiar with what everybody else was talking about.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
It turned out pretty well  we ended up helping them out and getting their students to have some faith and how these things of learning are applied.,0.8519,0.309,0.691,0.0,pp89
Yeah so I guess major time where a big obstacle is overcome.,-0.0772,0.15,0.68,0.17,pp89
Wonderful  thanks for sharing that.,0.8555,0.825,0.175,0.0,pp89
If you could change one thing about yourself  what would it be?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Um let’s see  well the first thing that popped in my mind was that uh if I was a little shorter I could be an astronaut.,0.2732,0.077,0.923,0.0,pp89
But I think the height requirement is changed for that.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
I’m 6’3” and I think a few years ago it was 6’1” which is the cut off.,-0.2732,0.0,0.884,0.116,pp89
You can’t change your height though so what could you change?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Okay yeah that too.,0.4767,0.672,0.328,0.0,pp89
Um I guess um let’s see  my um  uh I guess as far as larger scale positions go  like kind of being decisive.,0.5267,0.173,0.827,0.0,pp89
I think this is like a common problem for you know undergraduates here.,-0.0516,0.154,0.679,0.167,pp89
Because you know you come in and I guess a major way American schools are different from schools in other countries.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
We have all the options open and so um you know it’s a tough thing to you know have all these options and be decisive with one thing.,0.1027,0.065,0.884,0.051,pp89
And be able to like you know if you’re in an environment where you’re more restricted and you just put yourself in that.,-0.101,0.095,0.796,0.11,pp89
As far as larger scales go and smaller scales too with whether it’s  I don’t know just managing things just day to day.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
I feel like time management’s you know a major part of that being decisive stuff.,0.5267,0.253,0.747,0.0,pp89
Yeah I think decision making would be the main thing.,0.296,0.196,0.804,0.0,pp89
Good  so now think of a job that you’d like to have.,0.6597,0.351,0.649,0.0,pp89
So  one in mind?,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Yep.,0.296,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp89
Good.,0.4404,1.0,0.0,0.0,pp89
So why do you think we should hire you for this job.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pp89
Um well I’m standing by one of the things I mentioned before.,0.2732,0.16,0.84,0.0,pp89
Which is mainly that I think I communicate pretty well.,0.6486,0.398,0.602,0.0,pp89
As far as small groups  I’ve had a good amount of experience Working with people on  you know  in real time problem solving.,0.3818,0.189,0.714,0.096,pp89
I’ve had experience there and I think that’s a major attribute that I can bring to the board and bring to the table and um as far as experience goes  yeah I mean things I mentioned before just coming back as far as like Diversity of background and being able to bring multiple perspectives.,0.5719,0.083,0.917,0.0,pp89
I have kind of experience with physics and more like applied things like robotics.,0.6478,0.306,0.694,0.0,pp89
So I think that diversity of things really helps and um yeah.,0.624,0.337,0.663,0.0,pp89
Thanks  Steven.,0.4404,0.744,0.256,0.0,pp89
Thank you for coming here today.,0.3612,0.333,0.667,0.0,pp89
Yeah thank you.,0.5719,0.825,0.175,0.0,pp89
