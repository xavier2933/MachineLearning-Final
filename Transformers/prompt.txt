Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm doing very well  thanks. How are you?|Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: I'm currently a junior  pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and what's really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics. A lot of interesting questions come up where itâ€™s a lot of actually thinking innovatively and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve chose to major in both of these and  actually  thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m interesting in consulting is because itâ€™s a good application of the problem solving that Iâ€™m doing in both of those.|Interviewer: Tell me about a time youâ€™ve demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Umm  recently  I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project  however  umm  these was  I noticed a lack of communication  a lack of set deadlines  so  umm  in that case  I kind of stepped up. I organized communication between all of us. I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and  you know  itâ€™s a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline. Umm  Iâ€™ve also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured.|Uh huh.|Would you like me to tell you about one of those?|Interviewer: Yeah  thatâ€™d be great.|Interviewee: Okay. Umm  last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that  the biggest event  especially logistically  fell under my responsibilities  so I  with a $2 200 budget  organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston  so this involved  umm  finding places  making all food allergies were taken care of  really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening  and this also involved a lot of delegation because  you know  there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldnâ€™t personally be in charge of all of those  so I had to delegate out to a committee  make sure that they knew what was happening  manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left  who hadnâ€™t gone as yet  everyone knew their reservations  how to get there  how to get back. So  in that case  it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that.|Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Umm  let me see. I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we werenâ€™t all on the same page and not communicating.|Mmm. Uh huh.|Umm  I can also try to think of something else if you donâ€™t mind giving me just a minute.|Interviewer: Sure.|Interviewee: Umm  so I guess  in one of my classes last year  we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how  umm  and the way we kind of resolved that issue  because clearly  as an aspect  it needed to get done  we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out. So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time  whereas for the rest of us  we were more interested in the actual material  so we found a mutually agreeable solution.|Interviewer: Great. Tellâ€¦Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what youâ€™re doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Yes. Umm  I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything Iâ€™m doing  you know  that  like  Iâ€™m a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh  management really excites me too  I want to do that as well  which  in the past  has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit  which  as a result  when youâ€™re really excited about everything  but then you try to do everything  the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing  but Iâ€™m conscious of this year. I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars andâ€¦especially because last year  while doing all of those  I wasnâ€™t sleeping as much  which  you know  while I was still there and pulling my share and everything  you know  it was harder to be a full present member of anything if youâ€™re tired. So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and Iâ€™m aware of that  so when I feel myself reaching my limit  Iâ€™ll actually try to prioritize more.|Interviewer: Great. And why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: As I mentioned before  what Iâ€™m studying in school is very applicable to consulting  but  in addition to that  Iâ€™m really excited about the work that consultants do  especially  as I mentioned  Iâ€™m very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those  delve into them  and in consulting Iâ€™d get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both  which is  again  the problem solving  the thinking innovatively. These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do  so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that Iâ€™ve spoken to really engaging and it seems  from all of my previous conversations with them  that theyâ€™re really excited about this  which is  you know  exactly what I would hope to bring as well.

Here is an interview that got a score of 3.332:

Interviewer: So how are you doing today?|Interviewee: Um  pretty good. Um   yeah.|Interviewer: Good. So tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: So  um  my name is Dina Wong. I'm a student at MIT. I'm in my third year. I'm majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um  biologic-um  Computational Biology. Um It's pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year.|Interviewer: Oh wow|Interviewee: So yeah  so I've been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes. Um in my free time I like to  um  write for the Tech and a be edit  um articles at the  um the student newspaper  for the student newspaper. Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running  stuff like that.|Interviewer: Great what are your career goals.|Interviewee: So currently I'm looking for an internship for the summer. Um  I actually um  I'm exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate.|Interviewer: Great. Ok. So tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Ok. Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech. So a what happens is  um  like um  for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time.|Interviewer: mhm|Interviewee: So  um  one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um  column for for the campus life section. So there was a um  the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life. And so um  I negotiated with her to like um  sort to arrange how the column would work  because like um  I guess we both had the same like um  intent of how we should like publish articles  but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she  if your original idea was that she wanted to  I could  it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um  people like  like the Tech is a newspaper you donâ€™t like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um  write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey.|Interviewer: Ok great. So  tell me about a time you were on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Hmm  Ah...Um I guess again probably using um  let me see..ok so I guess again on  for the Tech cause it's like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular. Um  I guess um  what happened was um  shit  um I really donâ€™t know how to answer these type of questions sorry.|Interviewer: It's ok  take your time.|Interviewee: Um...|Interviewer: It doesn't necessarily be extracurricular either.|Interviewee: Um...Ok I guess I'll go back to high school then. So in high school I was on the cross country team and um  so what happened was we a like we're  we're competing right so we um  so we had to like  um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the  um so there's a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was  i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um  and the girls team was like less motivated and wha  and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut  take short cuts and stuff like that. Um  I guess what happened was my um  there was another student on the team who was also  who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um  could you not do that?  but eventually what happened was I guess we  me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way  like I mean there's  there's motivating people  but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess that's what happened.|Interviewer: Ok.  Great. So can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: OK  Um  I would  let me think. One of my  I guess one weakness I have is um  well MIT is full of smart people right. Um  if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff  so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like I'm not as at their level. So um  I guess what I try  what I try to do is like I  I was  feeling badly  but then I realized. Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere. I've been like training my own skills like  reach up to the  to learn more in depth and eventually I'll get that good  just takes like practice and I've also been like just sort of telling myself that it's  to like just apply to things and like donâ€™t  and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right. So make like um  project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come.|Interviewer: Great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Well um  so I've been learning a lot about um  computer science since I was here. I've um  I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything  getting thing in time  on deadline. Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I  and not procrastinate or anything like that. Um I'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um  I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a  I would be able to produce um  good products.|Interviewer: Great

This one got a score of 5.3:

Interviewer: So how are you doing?|Interviewee: Im pretty good.|Interviewer: Ok well  so please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: ok  uhm  so have you looked at my resume or should I  alright  so I guess ah  I am course 6-7 here at M.I.T  ah which is computational biology  so its a mix of computers  science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology.  Uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school  include Camp Kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer  as well as ah amphibious achievement  which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in Boston  |Interviewer:  mhhmm|Interviewee: So ah  my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care  I imagined I was going be a Doctor growing up  and then it came down to the tee and Im like  well I can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people.|Interviewer: So please tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Ok  uhm  one of the things we have to do for Camp Kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah  to  run the camp which is over $50 000.00.  Ah so one of the things that I individually spearhead every year is called the Camp Kesem I say you did auction  where actually my fraternity and I go out and solicit uhm  donations in the form of gift cards  ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates  and then we use this money obviously we donate it to Camp Kesem. I spearhead the entire event and I kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups  and I send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan.  |Interviewer: Tell me about a time when your working on a team and faced with a challenge  how did you solve that problem?|Interviewee:  Ahh  I guess the easiest team project I just I just had  was  last semester  uhm I worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture.|Interviewer:  uh hun.|Interviewee: and we were put in a group of 3 people  and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally  but it ended up being by the end of it  that someone didn't like put there fair share of work in...Ah essentially we talked to him we didn't really get it out  we actually had to go to some of the T.A's we got a little bit ah  and that kinda like pushed him forward  so I mean I guess what I am showing is like  Im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself.  |Interviewer: Oh yes.  Alright tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.|Interviewee:  Uhmmm.  I would say for this job  ah Im a little technically underprepared.  Ah I've yet  I have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes  but I think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles.|Interviewer:  Now why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee:  Ah  Im very interested  in the subject of computation biology  and I think that I will be able to contribute a lot to this field  uhm I've had a good amount of experience and I think I will be a solid intern.|Interviewer: Well thank you.
